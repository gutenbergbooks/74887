<p class="c xlarge">PREFACE.</p>

<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE collection of the Anecdotes now offered to the
public has been a work of some few years, but it has
also been a pleasure. Loving Art, I have taken a deep
interest in the light thrown by them on the character and
career of the great artists whose works have done so much
to elevate and refine mankind. These anecdotes have been
culled from various sources; and though many of them have
doubtless been several times related, yet some, it is believed,
have never before been published in a collected form. Mr.
Henry Ottley, in the Preface to his “Supplement to Bryan’s
Dictionary of Painters,” remarks that many artists to whom
he had applied for materials for biography, did not answer
his letters, and that others declined from a feeling of diffidence
to give him the required information. I have found
a similar difficulty in obtaining anecdotes by applying to
the artist friends with whom I have the honour of being
acquainted. My work has, therefore, been to seek materials
from other sources; to select, arrange, and, in some instances,
abridge. Whenever it was possible to give the
authority for a story, this has been done. The anecdotes
are arranged in groups, according to the artist to whom they
relate; and for convenience of reference, the names of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
artists are given alphabetically. It is hoped that this little
volume, while serving to wile away a leisure hour, may at
the same time do something to arouse the reader’s interest
in the men who have devoted their lives to the service of
Art, and so to the instruction and well-being of their fellow-men.</p>

<h2><i>ALLSTON (WASHINGTON).</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ASHINGTON ALLSTON was born at Charleston,
in South Carolina, on the 5th November, 1779,
of a family distinguished in the history of that State. He
entered Harvard College in 1796, and graduated in 1800.
While at college he developed in a marked manner a love
of music, poetry, and painting. On leaving college, he
returned to South Carolina, having determined to devote
his life to the fine arts, and embarked for London in 1801.
On his arrival, he became a student of the Royal Academy,
and formed an intimacy with his countryman, Benjamin
West, who was its president. After three years in London,
he paid visits to Paris and Rome, and in 1809 returned to
America. Two years afterwards, we find him again in
England, where his reputation as an artist was now completely
established. In 1818 he returned to America,
making Boston his home.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jameson, in her “Memoirs and Essays, illustrative
of Art,” says: “At Rome Allston first became distinguished
as a mellow and harmonious colourist, and
acquired among the native German painters the name of
“the American Titian.”</p>

<p>When in London, Allston paid a professional visit to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
Fuseli, who asked him what branch of art he intended
to pursue. He replied, “History.” “Then, sir,” answered
the shrewd and intelligent professor of painting, “you have
come a long way to starve.”</p>

<p>Allston was the author of several poems, which, with
his lectures on art, are edited by R. H. Dana, jun., and
published in New York. He died on the 9th of July,
1843.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c2"><i>HIS OPINION OF HIS OWN PAINTING.</i></p>

<p>Some years after Allston had acquired a considerable
reputation as a painter, a friend showed him a miniature,
and begged he would give his sincere opinion upon its
merits, as the young man who drew it had some thoughts
of becoming a painter by profession. After much pressing,
Allston candidly told the gentleman he feared the
lad would never do anything as a painter, and advised
his following some more congenial pursuit. The friend
thereupon convinced him that the miniature had been
done by Allston himself, for this very gentleman, when
the painter was very young.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c3"><i>BARTOLOZZI (FRANCESCO), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>RANCESCO BARTOLOZZI was born in Florence,
in the year 1728, where his father kept a shop,
and followed the business of a goldsmith, on the Ponto
Vecchio. Young Bartolozzi was taught drawing by Feretti,
a drawing-master in Florence, and instructed in engraving
by one Corsi, a very indifferent artist. His earliest
attempts in engraving were copying prints from Frey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
and Wagner, and engraving shop-cards, and saints for
friars. His first work, considered of any consequence,
was from a picture in the cloisters of Santa Maria
Novella, in Florence. When he was about eighteen,
by the advice of Feretti, he sent a specimen of his
abilities to Wagner, at Venice, which was satisfactorily
received; and from that time he became his pupil and
assistant, and remained with him ten years. While he
was with Wagner, Bartolozzi married and went to Rome,
where he remained a year and a half. Among other works,
he engraved, while at Rome, several heads of painters for
Bottari’s edition of Vasari.</p>

<p>In the year 1762, Mr. Dalton, the King’s agent for
works of art, being at Venice, introduced himself to the
artist, and took him to Bologna to make two drawings,—a
Cupid, from Guido, and the Circumcision, from Guercino,
which he afterwards engraved for him.</p>

<p>At Mr. Dalton’s invitation, Bartolozzi started for London
in the year 1764, and, on arriving in the metropolis, he
found his fame had, through the joint influence of his
friend Cipriani and Mr. Dalton, brought many noted
personages to his lodgings, desirous to make the artist’s
personal acquaintance. For three years and a half he
was wholly employed by Mr. Dalton, at a guinea a day.
He was one of the twenty-seven artists who memorialized
the King to establish a Royal Academy, and was nominated
a Royal Academician on its establishment in 1768. After
quitting Cipriani’s house, he lived in Broad Street, and in
Bentinck Street, Soho; and at last settled in a house at
North End, Fulham, where he took great delight in gardening,
and where he remained to live till November, 1802,
when he went to Portugal; after a residence in England of
more than thirty-eight years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>Although Bartolozzi was greatly patronized by the
public in this country, and in the receipt of a large
income, and his works held in the highest estimation,
yet, with a morbid sensibility, he always felt himself to
be a foreigner, and never quite at home in England. At
Lisbon he gave his attention to the superintendence of
a school of engraving recently established, from which he
received the sum of £200 yearly for his services.</p>

<p>The week before he left England, Lord Pelham sent his
private secretary to inform him that he was authorized by
His Majesty to make him an offer of £400 a year to
remain in England, and more, if that was not sufficient;
but this munificence Bartolozzi respectfully declined.</p>

<p>He died in the year 1815, in the eighty-fifth year of
his age.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c4"><i>INTERVIEW WITH GEORGE III.</i></p>

<p>“I was shaving myself in the morning,” says Bartolozzi,
“when a thundering rapping at the door announced
the glad tidings, and I cut myself in my hurry to go to
Buckingham House, where I was told His Majesty was
waiting for me in the library. When I arrived, I found
the King on his hands and knees on the floor, cleaning a
large picture with a wet sponge, and Mr. Dalton, Mr.
Barnard, the librarian, and another person standing by.
The subject of the picture was the ‘Murder of the Innocents,’
said to be by Paul Veronese, and I was sent for to
give my opinion of its originality. Mr. Dalton named me
to the King as a proper judge, as I had so lately come from
Venice; and I suppose he intended to give me some
previous instructions; but when delay was proposed, the
King said: ‘No; send for Mr. Bartolozzi now, and I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
wait here till he comes.’ On my entering the room, the
King asked me whether the picture was an undoubted
original by Paul Veronese; to which I gave a gentle shrug,
without saying a single word. The King seemed to understand
the full force of the expression, and, without requiring
any further comment, asked me how I liked
England, and if I found the climate agree with me; and
then walked out at the window which led into the garden,
and left Mr. Dalton to roll up his picture; and here ended
the consultation. The picture was an infamous copy, and
offered to the King for the <i>moderate</i> price of one thousand
guineas.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c5"><i>BEECHEY (SIR WILLIAM), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ILLIAM BEECHEY was born at Burford, in
Oxfordshire, in the year 1753. It is recorded of
this painter that the circumstance of a portrait of a nobleman
which he had painted being returned by the hanging committee
of the Exhibition led to his rapid advancement in
life. The picture found its way to Buckingham House,
was much admired by the royal family; and so led to his
receiving the patronage of His Majesty. In 1798 he was
commissioned to paint George III. on horseback reviewing
the troops. Beechey excelled in portrait-painting. Though
neat and delicate in his colouring, his portraits want that
dignity and grace so well shown in those of the great master,
Reynolds. He died in the year 1839.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c6"><i>INTERVIEW WITH HOLCROFT.</i></p>

<p>In Holcroft’s diary occurs the following reference to this
painter:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>“15 July, 1798.—Sir William Beechey, with his young son,
called; he was lately knighted. Speaks best on painting,
the subject on which we chiefly conversed. Said that a
notion prevailed in Italy, that pictures having a brown tone
had most the hue of Titian; and that the picture-dealers of
Italy smeared them over with some substance which communicates
this tone. Of this I doubt. Repeated a conversation
at which he was present, when Burke endeavoured to
persuade Sir Joshua Reynolds to alter his picture of ‘The
Dying Cardinal,’ by taking away the devil, which Burke
said was an absurd and ridiculous incident, and a disgrace
to the artist. Sir Joshua replied, that if Mr. Burke thought
proper, he could argue <i>per contra</i>; and Burke asked him if
he supposed him so unprincipled as to speak from anything
but conviction. ‘No,’ said Sir Joshua; ‘but had you happened
to take the other side, you could have spoken with
equal force.’... Beechey praised my portrait, painted
by Opie, but said the colouring was too foxy; allowed Opie
great merit, especially in his picture of ‘The Crowning of
Henry VI. at Paris;’ agreed with me that he had a bold
and determined mind, and that he nearest approached the
fine colouring of Rembrandt.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c7"><i>CHANTREY (SIR FRANCIS), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>IR FRANCIS was born on the 7th of April, 1782, at
Norton, in Derbyshire. He was early apprenticed to
a carver, with whom he served three years. In the year
1816, at the early age of eight-and-twenty, he became an
Associate of the Royal Academy, and after two years’ close
study he was elected an Academician. It has been justly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
said of this artist, that all his statues proclaim themselves
at once the works of a deeply-thinking man. His most
celebrated sepulchral monument, entitled “The Sleeping
Children,” is known all over Europe by engravings. It was
erected in memory of two children of the late William
Robinson, Esq. Chantrey died at his house, in Pimlico, on
the 25th of November, 1841.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c8"><i>CHANTREY’S PRICES.</i></p>

<p>In 1808 Chantrey received a commission to execute four
colossal busts for Greenwich Hospital:—those of Duncan,
Howe, St. Vincent, and Nelson; and from this time his
prosperity began. During the eight previous years he
declared he had not gained five pounds by his labours as a
modeller; and until he executed the bust of Horne Tooke,
in clay, in 1811, he was himself diffident of success. He
was, however, entrusted with commissions to the amount of
£12,000. His prices at this time were eighty or a hundred
guineas for a bust, and he continued to work at this rate for
three years, after which he raised his terms to a hundred
and twenty, and a hundred and fifty guineas, and continued
these prices until the year 1822, when he again raised the
terms to two hundred guineas; and when he modelled the
bust of George IV., the King wished him to increase the
price, and insisted that the bust of himself should not return
to the artist a less sum than three hundred guineas.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c9"><i>HORNE TOOKE.</i></p>

<p>Horne Tooke had rendered Chantrey many important
services, for which the latter through life took every opportunity
to show his gratitude. About a year previous to
Horne Tooke’s death, he desired the artist to procure for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
him a large black marble slab to place over his grave,
which he intended should be in his garden at Wimbledon.
This commission Chantrey executed, and went with Mrs.
Chantrey to dine with Tooke on the day that it was forwarded
to the dwelling of the latter. On the sculptor’s arrival, his
host merrily exclaimed, “Well, Chantrey, now that you have
sent my tombstone, I shall be sure to live a year longer,”
which was actually the case.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c10"><i>EQUESTRIAN FIGURES.</i></p>

<p>When George IV. was sitting to Chantrey, he required
the sculptor to give him the idea of an equestrian
statue to commemorate him, which Chantrey accomplished
at a succeeding interview by placing in the sovereign’s
hand a number of small equestrian figures, drawn carefully
on thick paper, and resembling in number and material a
pack of cards. These sketches pleased the King very much,
who turned them over and over, expressing his surprise that
such a variety could be produced; and after a thousand
fluctuations of opinion, sometimes for a prancing steed,
sometimes for a trotter, then for a neighing or starting
charger, His Majesty at length resolved on a horse
standing still, as the most dignified for a King. Chantrey
probably led to this, as he was decidedly in favour of the
four legs being on the ground; he had a quiet and reasonable
manner of convincing persons of the propriety of that
which from reflection he judged to be preferable....
When he had executed and erected the statue of the King
on the staircase at Windsor, His Majesty good-naturedly
patted the sculptor on the shoulder, and said, “Chantrey, I
have reason to be obliged to you, for you have immortalized
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>


<p class="c sp" id="c11"><i>CANDID OPINION.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Leslie relates the following anecdote:—</p>

<p>“Chantrey told me that on one of his visits to Oxford,
Professor Buckland said to him ‘If you will come to me,
you shall hear yourself well abused.’ He had borrowed a
picture of Bishop Heber, from the Hall of New College, to
make a statue from; and having kept it longer than he had
promised, the woman who showed the Hall was very bitter
against him. ‘There is no dependence,’ she said, ‘to be
placed on that Chantrey. He is as bad as Sir Thomas
Lawrence, who has served me just the same; there is not a
pin to choose between them.’ She pointed to the empty
frame, and said, ‘It is many a shilling out of my pocket,
the picture not being there; they make a great fuss about
that statue of——’ (mentioning one by Chantrey, that had
lately been sent to one of the colleges), ‘but we have one
by Bacon, which, in my opinion, is twice as good. When
Chantrey’s statue came, I had ours washed; I used a dozen
pails of water, and I am sure I made it look a great deal
better than his.’ He took out a five-shilling piece, and
putting it into her hand, but without letting it go, said,
‘Look at me, and tell me whether I look like a very bad
man.’ ‘Lord, no, sir.’ ‘Well, then, I am that Chantrey
you are so angry with.’ She seemed somewhat disconcerted;
but quickly recovering herself, replied, ‘And if you
are, sir, I have said nothing but what is true,’ and he
resigned the money into her hand.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c12"><i>FASHION.</i></p>

<p>On one occasion, at a dinner party, he was placed nearly
opposite his wife at table, at the time when very large and
full sleeves were worn, of which Lady C. had a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
fashionable complement; and the sculptor perceived that
a gentleman sitting next to her was constrained to confine
his arms, and shrink into the smallest dimensions, lest he
should derange the superfluous attire. Chantrey, observing
this, addressed him thus: “Pray, sir, do not inconvenience
yourself from the fear of spoiling those sleeves, for that lady
is my wife; those sleeves are mine, and as I have paid for
them, you are at perfect liberty to risk any injury your
personal comfort may cause to those prodigies of fashion!”
Also, noticing a lady with sleeves curiously cut, he affected
to think the slashed openings were from economical motives,
and said, “What a pity the dressmaker should have spoiled
your sleeves! It was hardly worth while to save such a
little bit of stuff.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c13"><i>CONSTABLE (JOHN), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>OHN CONSTABLE, born in Suffolk, in the year 1776,
passed his infancy in a beautifully rural country, the
scenery of which he was in love with to the day of
his death. His predilection for the art was developed
before he reached the age of sixteen. Mrs. Constable
procured for her son an introduction to Sir George
Beaumont. Sir George had expressed himself much
pleased with the youth’s pen-and-ink copies. He was
sent to pursue his studies in London; and in 1799, writing
to a friend, he says:—</p>

<p>“I paint by all the daylight we have, and there is little
enough. I sometimes see the sky; but imagine to yourself
how a pearl must look through a burnt glass. I employ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
my evenings in making drawings and in reading, and I
hope by the former to clear my rent. If I can, I shall be
very happy. Our friend Smith has offered to take any of
my pictures into his shop for sale. He is pleased to find I
am reasonable in my prices.”</p>

<p>Again, in Leslie’s memoirs of the artist we have the
following memorandum of Constable:—</p>

<p>“For these few weeks past I have thought more
seriously of my profession than at any other time of my
life; of that which is the surest way to excellence. I am
just returned from a visit to Sir George Beaumont’s pictures,
with a deep conviction of the truth of Sir Joshua Reynolds’
observation, that ‘there is no easy way of becoming a good
painter.’ For the last two years I have been running after
pictures, and seeking the truth at second-hand. I have
not endeavoured to represent nature with the same elevation
of mind with which I set out, but have rather tried
to make my performances look like the work of other men.
I am come to a determination to make no idle visits this
summer, nor to give up my time to commonplace people.
I shall return to Bergholt, where I shall endeavour to get
a pure and unaffected manner of representing the scenes
that may employ me. There is little or nothing in the
Exhibition worth looking up to. <i>There is room enough for
a natural painter.</i> The great vice of the present day is
<i>bravura</i>,—an attempt to do something beyond the truth.
Fashion always had, and will have, its day; but truth in
all things only will last, and can only have just claims on
posterity. I have reaped considerable benefit from exhibiting;
it shows me where I am, and in fact tells me
what nothing else could.”</p>

<p>Constable kept up a wide correspondence among his
friends, from which correspondence one of his most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
intimate friends, C. R. Leslie, compiled and published,
with much taste and discretion, Memoirs of his Life.</p>

<p>Constable died in the year 1837.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c14"><i>ARCHDEACON FISHER.</i></p>

<p>After preaching one Sunday, the archdeacon asked the
artist how he liked his sermon: he replied—“Very much
indeed, Fisher; I always did like that sermon.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c15"><i>CONSTABLES PLEASANTRY.</i></p>

<p>A picture of a murder sent to the Academy for exhibition
while Constable was on the council, was refused admittance
on account of a disgusting display of blood and brains in
it; but Constable objected still more to the wretchedness
of the work, and said: “I see no <i>brains</i> in the picture.”</p>

<p>This recalls another which is related of Opie, who, when
a young artist asked him what he mixed his colours with,
replied, “<i>Brains</i>.”</p>

<p>It being complained to him by his servant that the milk
supplied was very poor and weak in quality, he said one
morning to the milkman: “In future, we shall feel obliged
if you will send us the milk and the water in separate
cans.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c16"><i>COLLINS (WILLIAM), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ILLIAM COLLINS was born in London, in
September, 1788. At an early age his father
noticed his son’s talent, and sent him to the Royal Academy
to pursue his studies. His skill in a short time was such
that he became a valuable assistant to his father in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
business of cleansing and restoring pictures; and when
he rose to paint pictures for himself, his father was at a loss
what to do without him.</p>

<p>“The first intimation I gave,” says his father, “of my
incapacity to restore, or even line, the pictures without the
aid of my son William, was on last Wednesday. There
was a beautiful large landscape by Ostade—the figures by
A. Teniers. I pointed out the necessary repairs in the
sky which were wanted to make the picture complete; and,
of course, mentioned Bill as superior to every other artist
in that department. The squire listened very attentively
until I had done, and then inquired what the expense of
such repairs might be. I answered, about two or three
guineas. “Oh, d——n the sky! clean it and stick it up
without any repairs then!”</p>

<p>In 1807, Collins became for the first time exhibitor at
the Royal Academy, and fifteen years later a Royal Academician,
He married in 1822. He passed the years 1837
and 1838 studying his art in Italy. He says in his journal:
“A painter should choose those subjects with which people
associate pleasant circumstances: it is not sufficient that
a scene pleases <i>him</i>.” And this advice it is plain he acted
upon himself to the end of his career. While living, he
had the satisfaction (very rare to the most successful) of
seeing his pictures fetch high prices. For instance—for
his “Frost Scene” Sir Robert Peel paid him 500 guineas,
Mr. Young gave him for his “Skittle Players” 400 guineas;
and the same sum was paid him by Sir Thomas Baring for
his “Mussel Gatherers.”</p>

<p>The life of Collins was a success from the first year he
entered as a student at the Royal Academy; and though
his life has been called uneventful, the English artist will
ever cherish his name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>He died in 1847, aged fifty-nine. His Life, with selections
from his correspondence, is plainly and affectionately
told by the artist’s son, Mr. Wilkie Collins, published in
two vols., 1848.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c17"><i>COMPLAINT AGAINST THE HANGING COMMITTEE.</i></p>

some accident from the people who are continually looking
at Mr. Bird’s picture; I take the liberty of requesting you
will allow me to order a sort of case to be put round the

picture) from the kicks of the crowd. Even the degrading
situation in which the picture is placed would not have

it be done any morning before the opening of the

authority for bringing in a workman for that purpose. I
cannot help expressing some surprise that you should consider
the situation of your picture degrading, knowing as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>

and that, as low as it is, many members of the

</div>

<p class="c sp" id="c18">“<i>THE BIRD CATCHERS.</i>”</p>

<p>Mr. Stark, the landscape painter, supplied the following
interesting notice of this famous picture:—</p>

<p>“In order to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the
process of bird-catching, he (Collins) went into the fields
(now the Regent’s Park) before sunrise, and paid a man to
instruct him in the whole mystery; and I believe if the
arrangement of the nets, cages, and decoy birds, with the
disposition of the figures, lines connected with the nets,
and birds attached to the sticks, were to be examined by a
Whitechapel bird-catcher, he would pronounce them to be
perfectly correct. He was unable to proceed with the
picture for some days, fancying that he wanted the assistance
of Nature in a piece of broken foreground; and whilst
this impression remained, he said he should be unable to
do more. I went with him to Hampstead Heath; and
although he was not successful in meeting with anything
that suited his purpose, he felt that he could then finish the
picture; but while the impression was on his mind that
anything could be procured likely to lead to the perfection
of the work, he must satisfy himself by making the effort—even
if it proved fruitless. I have perhaps said more on
this picture than you may deem necessary; but it was the
first work of this description that I had been acquainted
with, and the only picture, excepting those of my late
master, Crome, that I had ever seen in progress. Moreover,
I believe it to have been the first picture of its particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
class ever produced in this country; and this, both in
subject and treatment, in a style so peculiarly your late
father’s, and one which has gained for him so much fame.”</p>

<p>The painter himself has left the following memoranda on
this picture:—</p>

<p>“Two days since, Constable compared a picture to a <i>sum</i>;
for it is wrong if you can take away or add a figure to it.
In my picture of ‘Bird-Catchers,’ to avoid red, blue, and
yellow—-to recollect that Callcott advised me to paint some
parts of my picture thinly (leaving the ground)—and that
he gave credit to the man who never reminded you of the
palette.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c19"><i>HAYDON’S “JUDGMENT OF SOLOMON.”</i></p>

<p>“Went to Spring Gardens,” says Collins, “to see Haydon’s
picture of ‘The Judgment of Solomon.’ In this most
extraordinary production there is everything for which the
Venetian school is so justly celebrated; with this difference
only, that Haydon has considered other qualities equally
necessary. Most men who have arrived at such excellence
in colour, have seemed to think they have done
enough; but with Haydon it was evidently the signal of
his desire to have every greatness of every other school.
Hence, he lays siege to the drawing and expression of
Nature, which, in this picture, he has certainly carried from,
and in the very face of, all his competitors. Of the higher
qualities of Art are certainly the tone of the whole picture;
the delicate variety of colour; the exquisite sentiment in
the mother bearing off her children; and the consciousness
of Solomon in the efficacy of his demonstration of the real
mother. In short, Haydon deserves the praise of every real
artist for having proved that it is possible (which, by the
way, I never doubted) to add all the beauties of colour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and tone to the grandeur of the most sublime subject,
without diminishing the effect upon the heart. Haydon has
done all this; and produced, upon the whole, the most
perfect modern picture I ever saw; and that at the age of
seven-and-twenty!”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c20"><i>SAMUEL T. COLERIDGE.</i></p>

<p>Among the correspondence of Collins occurs the following
characteristic letter to him from this celebrated writer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="r">
“<span class="smcap">To W. Collins, Esq., A.R.A.<br>
Highgate</span>, <i>December</i>, 1818.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,—I at once comply with, and thank you
for, your request to have some prospectuses. God knows I
have so few friends, that it would be unpardonable in me
not to feel proportionably grateful towards those few who
think the time not wasted in which they interest themselves
in my behalf. There is an old Latin adage: ‘<i>Vis videri
pauper, et pauper es.</i>’ Poor you profess yourself to be, and
poor therefore you are, and will remain. The prosperous
feel only with the prosperous; and if you subtract from the
whole sum of their feeling for all the gratifications of vanity
and all their calculations of <i>lending to the Lord</i>, both of which
are best answered by conferring the superfluity of their
superfluities on advertised and advertisable distress—or on
such as are known to be in all respects their inferiors—you
will have, I fear, but a scanty remainder. All this is too
true; but then, what is that man to do whom no distress
can bribe to swindle or deceive? who cannot reply as
Theophilus Cibber did to his father, Colley Cibber, who,
seeing him in a rich suit of clothes, whispered to him as he
passed, ‘The.! The.! I pity thee!’ ‘Pity me! pity my
tailor!’ Spite of the decided approbation which my plan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
of delivering lectures has received from several judicious
and highly respectable individuals, it is too histrionic, too
much like a retail dealer in instruction and pastime, not
to be depressing. If the duty of living were not far more
awful to my conscience than life itself is agreeable to my
feelings, I should sink under it. But, getting nothing by
my publications, which I have not the power of making
estimable by the public without loss of self-estimation, what
can I do? The few who have won the present age, while
they have secured the praise of posterity, as Sir Walter Scott,
Mr. Southey, Lord Byron, etc., have been in happier circumstances.
And lecturing is the only means by which I
can enable myself to go on at all with the great philosophical
work to which the best and most genial hours of the last
twenty years of my life have been devoted. Poetry is out of
the question. The attempt would only hurry me into that
sphere of acute feelings from which abstruse research, the
mother of self-oblivion, presents an asylum. Yet sometimes,
spite of myself, I cannot help bursting out into the affecting
exclamation of our Spenser (his ‘wine’ and ‘ivy garland’
interpreted as competence and joyous circumstances),—</p>

would unwillingly exchange for the more dignified, ‘and
once more love the Muse,’ etc. And so, with many other
of Herbert’s homely phrases. We are all anxious to hear

<p>Collins was much amused on one occasion by the
remark of some fishermen. Having made a careful study
of some boats and other objects on the beach, which
occupied him the greater part of the day, towards evening,
when he was preparing to leave, the sun burst out low in
the horizon, producing a very beautiful, although totally
different, effect on the same objects; and with his usual
enthusiasm, he immediately set to work again, and had
sufficient light to preserve the effect. The fishermen
seemed deeply to sympathize with him at this unexpected
and additional labour as they called it; and endeavoured
to console him by saying, “Well, never mind, sir; every
business has its troubles.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c22"><i>COPLEY (JOHN SINGLETON), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>OHN SINGLETON COPLEY was born at Boston in
America, 3rd July, 1737. His father was of English
descent, and having resided a long time in Ireland,
many claimed the painter, when he became eminent, as a
native of the sister Isle. When eight or nine years old, he
would remain in an old lumber room for several hours at
a time, drawing, in charcoal, figures on the wall. At that
time Boston had neither academy nor private instructors in
the art; and the young artist had therefore to educate
himself. In the year 1760 he sent his first painting anonymously
to the Exhibition of the Royal Academy, which
raised high expectations among the academicians. Seven
years after, his name was well known to admirers of Art,
both in America and England. So proud were the Bostonians
of him, that they provided as many commissions as he
could execute. He visited London in 1774; but after a
short stay he left it for Italy. He thus writes to an acquaintance
from Rome,—“Having seen the Roman school, and
the wonderful efforts of genius exhibited by Grecian
artists, I now wish to see the Venetian and Flemish schools.
There is a kind of luxury in seeing, as well as there is in
eating and drinking; the more we indulge, the less are
we to be restrained; and indulgence in Art I think innocent
and laudable.... The only considerable stay which
I intend to make will be at Parma, to copy the fine Correggio.
Art is in its utmost perfection here; a mind susceptible
of the fine feelings which Art is calculated to excite
will find abundance of pleasure in this country. The
Apollo, the Laocoön, etc., leave nothing for the human
mind to wish for; more cannot be effected by the genius of
man than what is happily combined in those miracles of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
the chisel.” Copley returned to London, and being introduced
by West to the Academy, the King, in 1783, sanctioned
his election as an R.A. His name being established, year
after year witnessed works of high and enduring merit
from his brush. He was never idle. The merit of his
paintings was the more surprising when it was considered
with what rapidity they were executed. Perhaps among
his best works are the following, “King Charles ordering
the arrest of the five Members of Parliament,” “The
Death of Chatham,” and “The Death of Major Pierson,” a
young officer who fell in the defence of St. Helier’s against
the French. This picture was painted for Boydell; and
when, long afterwards, his gallery was dispersed, was purchased
back by the artist, and was subsequently in the
possession of his son, the late Lord Lyndhurst, who, to his
credit, was at the time of his death the owner of several of
the best works of his distinguished parent. Copley died
9th September, 1815.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c23"><i>PORTRAIT PAINTING.</i></p>

<p>A portrait painter in large practice might write a pretty
book on the vanity and singularity of his sitters. A certain
man came to Copley, and had himself, and wife, and
seven children all included in a family piece. “It wants
but one thing,” said he, “and that is the portrait of my
first wife—for this one is my second.” “But,” said the
artist, “she is dead you know, sir: what can I do? she
is only to be admitted as an angel.” “Oh, no! not at all,”
answered the other; “she must come in as a woman—no
angels for me.” The portrait was added, but some time
elapsed before the person came back; when he returned,
he had a stranger lady on his arm. “I must have another
cast of your hand, Copley,” he said: “an accident befel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
my second wife; this lady is my third; and she is come to
have her likeness included in the family picture.” The
painter complied—the likeness was introduced—and the
husband looked with a glance of satisfaction on his three
spouses. Not so the lady; she remonstrated; never was
such a thing heard of! out her predecessors must go. The
artist painted them out accordingly, and had to bring an
action at law to obtain payment for the portraits he had
obliterated.—<i>Life of Copley: Family Library.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c24"><i>DAVID (JACQUES LOUIS).</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>ACQUES LOUIS DAVID, the celebrated French painter,
was born in Paris in the year 1748, and studied under
Vienne. It is said of him, that while endeavouring to
give an air of antique character to his works, he was too often
cold and inexpressive, resembling coloured statuary more
than nature. By many admirers he is looked up to as the
head and restorer of the French school. The following
may be reckoned as his most celebrated pictures:—“The
Rape of the Sabines,” “The Coronation of Napoleon,”
“The Oath taken in the Tennis Court,” “Brutus,”
“Belisarius,” “The Funeral of Patroclus,” and “The Death
of Socrates.” He died in December, 1825.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c25"><i>DAVID’S MARRIAGE.</i></p>

<p>Jacques Louis David was very successful with his pupils.
At each distribution of prizes at the Academy of Rome, one
of his pupils generally bore away the palm. The King of
France, who acknowledged the royalty of the arts, ordered
apartments to be prepared for David in the Louvre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>Till then, David had never dreamed of marrying; he only
thought of the productions of his genius. Before taking
possession of his apartments in the Louvre, it was necessary
for him to come to some arrangement with Pécoul, the
King’s architect. David had known his son at Rome. They
had often talked together of their country and absent
families. Pécoul’s son had said to David, “I have some
handsome sisters; you must choose one, and we shall then
be brothers.” On the painter’s departure for Paris, he had
given him a letter to his father, principally as an introduction
to his sisters. More than two years had passed by, and the
letter still remained in a portfolio of drawings. One day,
as David turned it over, he said—“Who knows but destiny
may have traced this?” And so it remained for another six
months.</p>

<p>At last he called on Pécoul.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said the architect, “you are David, and you want
apartments in the Louvre?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, the King has had the kindness to allow me to
reside there.”</p>

<p>David had the letter in his pocket; he blushed, drew it
out, and gave it, with much emotion, to the architect.</p>

<p>“Egad!” said Pécoul, “this letter will still keep a little
longer; come and dine with me, and we will read it at the
dessert.” Saying this, Pécoul, in his turn, put the letter into
his pocket.</p>

<p>David went to dinner. There was a great display of
luxury and coquetry. It was Pécoul’s ardent wish that the
glory and fortune of David should spring from his own
house.</p>

<p>At the dessert, Pécoul took out his son’s letter and read
it aloud. This was like a piece of theatrical clap-trap. The
profoundest silence ensued; the young girls held down their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
heads while eyeing David. David interrogated the sphinx.
Pécoul, as he read the letter, tried also to read the thoughts
of David in his eyes. The mother alone thought of him
who had written the letter, for her son was still at Rome.</p>

<p>The letter ran as follows:—“The bearer of this, dear
father, is my best friend; do your utmost that he may
become my brother. This will be easy enough; he is twenty-five,
and you have some marriageable daughters; he has
genius, and you have money.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Pécoul finished reading; but his auditors were
still listening.</p>

<p>“You see, mesdemoiselles,” at last said David, taken
unexpectedly, “how your brother settles matters. I am
quite confused at his good opinion of me; but he does not
seem to know that neither daughter nor sister ought to be
forced, where marriage is concerned. As for me, who am
alone in the world, I should be too happy to people my
solitude with beauty and virtue.”</p>

<p>After an awkward pause, the architect broke silence by
telling David that he would religiously follow his son’s
advice, especially as the celebrated painter of “Belisarius”
had no natural aversion to matrimony. The conversation
resumed its liveliness, and every one spoke much and gaily;
but when David rose to leave, he did not yet know which
of the two young girls he should marry. Of the two beauties
he married the Roman type.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c26"><i>DAVID’S CRUELTY.</i></p>

<p>It is related of David, that during the reign of terror,
when the executions were most numerous and indiscriminate,
he would give vent to his ferocious nature by exclaiming
with a chuckle, “<i>C’est ça, il faut encore broyer du rouge</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>


<p class="c sp" id="c27"><i>HIS EXCESSIVE VANITY.</i></p>

<p>His cruelty was only equalled by his vanity and sycophancy.
Boasting of being like Robespierre—incorruptible,
one who knew him remarked, “I know what would bribe
you!” “What?” he indignantly exclaimed. “An apotheosis
in the Pantheon during your lifetime,” was the answer.</p>

<p>On his death-bed, at the direction of his physicians, an
engraving of one of his works was shown him to test the
state of his faculties; he cast on it his glassy eyes, and muttered,
“<i>Il n’y a que moi qui pouvait concevoir la tête de
Léonidas.</i>”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c28"><i>DANTON’S FEATURES.</i></p>

<p>David, who regarded as a demi-god Danton, the organizer
of the massacre of the prisons during the reign of terror,
attempted several times to delineate the horrid countenance
of this remarkable man; at last, giving up the attempt as
impossible, David exclaimed, “<i>Il serait plus facile de
peindre l’éruption d’un volcan, que les traits de ce grand
homme.</i>”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c29"><i>DAVID AND NAPOLEON.</i></p>

<p>In his celebrated picture of the distribution of the eagles
to Napoleon’s legions, David had represented Victory soaring
over them, holding forth crowns of laurel. “What do you
mean, sir, by this foolish allegory?” exclaimed the Emperor,
“it was perfectly unnecessary. Without borrowing such
absurd fictions, the world must know that all my soldiers are
conquerors.” On returning some days after this ebullition of
temper, the Emperor was delighted at finding David had
painted three scrolls, bearing the names of Buonaparte,
Hannibal, and Charlemagne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>


<p class="c sp" id="c30"><i>DAVID AND THE EMPEROR’S PORTRAIT.</i></p>

<p>Before painting the Emperor’s portrait, he asked him how
he would be represented. “On the field of victory, sire,
sword in hand?” “Bah!” replied the Emperor. “Victories
are not gained by the sword. Represent me, sir, dashing
forward on a fiery steed.”</p>

<p>Again, when requested to sit a little more steadily, to
obtain a good resemblance, Napoleon replied: “Pshaw, sir!
who cares for a resemblance? What are mere features, sir?
The genius of the artist is shown by his success in representing
the fire—the inspiration of the face. Think you, sir,
Alexander ever sat to Apelles?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c31"><i>DENON (DOMINIQUE VIVANT).</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>OMINIQUE VIVANT DENON was born in a
small town of Burgundy, of a noble family, in the
year 1747. He was appointed by the King, at an early age,
gentleman-in-ordinary. Soon after, he was made secretary
of embassy, and accompanied Baron Talleyrand to Naples.
It was in this capacity, during the absence of Talleyrand,
that Denon charmed all he had acquaintance with by his
rare superiority of talent and depth of conception, which,
lying concealed under an inexhaustible fund of wit and
humour, was not even suspected to exist till the wit and
courtier vanished to make room for the diplomatist. While
in Italy, he devoted his mornings to the study of the Fine
Arts, of which he was passionately fond. He was selected
by Buonaparte to accompany him to Egypt, in which
celebrated campaign Denon by turns wielded the sword
and handled the pencil. It was remarked by all that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
stock of gaiety never deserted him, even when under the
severest privations. Many instances are recorded of his
humanity and feeling on crossing the desert. His terrific
picture of the Arab dying in the desert of hunger and
thirst was taken from nature; and such and even worse
scenes were daily met with by the artist during this memorable
undertaking of the great general. Denon returned
with Buonaparte to France, and prepared his immortal
travels in Upper and Lower Egypt during the Egyptian
campaigns. This work, which has obtained the highest
suffrages, and been translated into almost all European
languages, was much admired by Buonaparte himself. One
day, on looking over the work, Napoleon said, “If I lost
Egypt, Denon has conquered it.” As a mark of appreciation
of Denon’s talent and attachment, he was appointed
by Napoleon director and administrator-general of the
museums and medal-mint. This office was just in accordance
with Denon’s taste and talents. No medals were
allowed to be struck of which the designs and execution
had not received the approbation of Denon; and to this
cause, say the connoisseurs, is to be attributed the uniform
superiority of the Napoleon medals in beauty of execution
over every other collection in the world. Denon was
specially appointed to superintend the erection of the
column in the Place Vendôme in honour of the battle of
Austerlitz. The model was to be the column of Trajan at
Rome; but, it is generally agreed, Denon greatly surpassed
his model. After the fall of Napoleon, Denon lived in
retirement, occupying himself with his collection of medals,
etc. His cabinet was open several days in the week, and
was resorted to by strangers from all parts of the world.
For the last seven years before his death, which took place
in the year 1825, he employed his spare moments in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
composition of a work on the “History of Art,” with about
300 to 400 plates from his own cabinet. The subscription
was soon closed after his intention was known. Many of
the first French artists, it is said, owe their advancement in
life to his interest and influence. He died at the age of
seventy-eight.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c32"><i>NAIVETÉ OF TALLEYRAND’S WIFE.</i></p>

<p>“Talleyrand invited Denon to dinner. When he went
home to his wife, he said, ‘My dear, I have invited Denon
to dine. He is a great traveller, and you must say something
handsome to him about his travels, as he may be
useful to us with the Emperor.’ His wife being extremely
ignorant, and probably never having read any other books
of travels than that of Robinson Crusoe, concluded that
Denon could be nobody else than Robinson. Wishing to
be very civil to him, she, before a large company, asked him
divers questions about his man Friday! Denon, astonished,
did not know what to think at first; but at length discovered
by her questions that she really imagined him to be Robinson
Crusoe. His astonishment and that of the company
cannot be described, nor the peals of laughter which it
excited in Paris, as the story flew like wildfire through the
city; and even Talleyrand himself was ashamed of it.”—<i>Gentleman’s
Magazine.</i></p>


<p class="c sp" id="c33"><i>DENON’S CURIOSITIES.</i></p>

<p>The following are a few of the many curiosities sold by
auction in Paris in 1846. Various instruments which belonged
to the tribunal of the Inquisition at Valladolid. The
ring of John-without-Fear, Duke of Burgundy, who was
assassinated on the bridge of Monterau; the ring being
found in his grave in 1792. Plaster casts of the heads of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Cromwell, Charles XII., and Robespierre. Fragments of
bones found in the burial place of the Cid and Ximena at
Burgos. Bones from the grave of Abelard and Heloise
at Paraclete. Hair of Agnes Sorel, who was burned at
Loches, and of Ines de Castro, at Alkaboga. Part of the
moustaches of Henry IV., found in excellent preservation
when the royal tombs at St. Denis were emptied in 1793.
A piece of Turenne’s shroud. Bones of Molière and
La Fontaine. Some hair of General Desaix. A tooth of
Voltaire. A piece of the shirt stained with blood worn
by Napoleon at the time of his death. A lock of his hair,
and a leaf of the weeping willow which overshadows his
grave at St. Helena.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c34"><i>FLAXMAN (JOHN), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>LAXMAN held the distinguished position of Professor
of Sculpture to the Royal Academy. He was an
excellent Greek and Latin scholar, and his mind seems to
have been early imbued with that classic feeling and taste
which it is essential for an historical sculptor to possess, and
which laid the foundation of his future celebrity. He was
admitted a Student of the Royal Academy, in 1770. In 1787,
Mr. Flaxman went to Italy, where he pursued his studies
for seven years. While resident at Rome, he made about
eighty designs from the Iliad and Odyssey. These were so
highly approved that he was afterwards engaged to illustrate,
in the same manner, the works of Dante for Mr. Thomas
Hope, and Æschylus for the late Countess Spencer. All
these designs were made at Rome, and engraved there by
Thomas Piroli. The Homer was published in quarto, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
1793, and again, with additional plates, in 1805; the
Æschylus, in 1795; the Dante, in 1807. His illustrations
of Hesiod were made after his return to England; they were
engraved by W. Blake, and published in 1816. Mr. Flaxman
returned from Rome in 1794, and was elected on his
way a Member of the Academies of Florence and Carrara.
His first work after his arrival in England, and for which he
received the commission before he left Rome, was the monument
to Lord Mansfield, in Westminster Abbey. He designed
and executed many other sepulchral monuments, the most
notable being those of Earl Howe, Lord Nelson, and Sir
Joshua Reynolds, in St. Paul’s cathedral; while Westminster
Abbey, and various other cathedrals and churches, are
enriched with exquisite productions of his genius. Flaxman
died, 3rd December, 1826, at the age of seventy-one.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c35"><i>HIS OBLIGING DISPOSITION.</i></p>

<p class="r">“<span class="smcap">Buckingham Street, Fitzroy Square</span>,<br>

“<i>19th of Aug</i>. 1814.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—Your first respected letter was duly received,
concerning the drawing for Dr. Whitaker’s new edition of
‘The History of Leeds;’ the answer to which has been delayed
so long because I wished to send by it such information
respecting the manner of engraving the monument of
Captains Walker and Beckett, with the expense, as might
enable Dr. Whitaker and yourself to determine what kind of
print will be most likely to answer the purpose of publication—which
will consequently determine the kind of drawing
from which the copper-plate must be engraved. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
information I have just obtained. A highly-finished
shadowed engraving, of the proper size for a quarto book,
will cost twenty guineas, or more; and in this department
of Art there are two engravers of distinguished excellence,
Mr. Bromley and Mr. Englehart. For such an engraving
a drawing should be made by Mr. Stothard, who is used to
draw for engravers; which is an absolute requisite, as this
is a distinct branch of Art. A drawing of this kind costs
about five or six guineas. If the Rev. Doctor would be
satisfied with an outline of the monument—such as those
published of Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, as well as some in
Cowper’s translations of Milton’s Latin poems, which is now
a favourite style of decoration in books—I can make the
outline myself, and will request the Editor’s acceptance of
it. The engraving, including the copper-plate, will cost
six guineas if done by Mr. Blake, the best engraver of
outlines. When you favour me with Dr. Whitaker’s intentions
on this subject, pray send in the letter the size of the
intended book. I hope you will excuse the trouble I have
occasioned you; and accept my particular thanks for your
kindness and attention.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c36"><i>FUSELI (HENRY), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>ENRY FUSELI was a native of Zurich, and came
to England at an early age, being undecided whether
to make Literature or Art his study. He happened to take
some of his drawings to Sir Joshua Reynolds, and requested
the great painter to give his candid opinion upon their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
execution. The President was so struck with the power of
conception displayed in them, that after attentively viewing
them, he said, “Young man, were I the author of these
drawings, and offered ten thousand a year not to practise as
an artist, I would reject it with contempt.” This opinion, so
flattering, decided him. In 1798, on the opening of his
Milton Gallery, he fully satisfied all who might previously
have had misgivings, by a rare display of lofty imagination,
blended with extensive intellectual acquirements. All were
agreed upon his marvellous genius as displayed in that
exhibition. Among his masterly works in the Shakspeare
Gallery, his “Ghost of Hamlet’s Father” was, perhaps, the
grandest. Mr. Fuseli enjoyed the friendship of the most
distinguished literati of the age. His townsman, Lavater,
entertained a very high opinion of him before ever he discovered
his genius by his after career. On leaving his native
town to begin life, Lavater put into his hand a small piece
of paper, beautifully framed, on which was written, “Do but
the tenth part of what you <i>can</i> do.” “Hang that up in your
bed-room,” said Lavater, “and I know what will be the
result.” Mr. Fuseli enjoyed excellent health, no doubt the
result of his habitual temperance; whether in town or
country, summer or winter, he was seldom in bed after five
o’clock. He died in the year 1825, at the ripe old age of
84, and his remains were interred in St. Paul’s cathedral.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c37"><i>HIS CAT.</i></p>

<p>It is related of the famous Fuseli, that he had a very imperfect
sympathy for the harmless domestic cat. One day
he was heard roaring at the top of his voice, “Same, Same,
why the devil don’t you come?” The affectionate Mrs.
F., who was in an adjoining room, rushed out, and
catching sight of her husband’s agonized features, asked in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
dismay, “What do you want of Sam, my dear Henry?” The
only reply to which was, “Oh! d—— your dear Henry; send
up Same.” On hastening to his assistance, the professor was
found sprawling on his back, and pointing to the great
doors of his painting room. It was found that he had a few
minutes before gone there to take out a large picture to paint
upon, when a couple of cats that had crawled through the
roof rushed out and confronted him, thus causing all the
disturbance. The man for whom he had called so vigorously
by the name of “Same,” was Samuel Stronger, his model, who
found his patron as white as a ghost.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c38"><i>HIS GAITERS.</i></p>

<p>It was not unusual for Fuseli to walk into the students’
room, with his gaiters in his hand. He would put them on
just before the Academy closed for the night. One night, in
his hurry to begin, he forgot the gaiters, or rather mislaid
them. A long-continued grumbling announced to the
students present that something was wrong. One of the
students, less careful than the others, began to titter; this
caught the professor’s ears, who bounced out of the room,
exclaiming, “Oh! you are all a set of teeves; you have stolen
my gaiters!” The merriment had not subsided, when, reappearing
with the missing articles in his hand, and assuming
as bland a smile as he could command, he apologetically
added, “Oh, no! I was the teef myself. It was I who stole
the gaiters!”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c39"><i>THE DRAMA.</i></p>

<p>Fuseli was a profound scholar in the works of Shakspeare,
so much so that he had the various passages of the plays at
his fingers’ ends. As an illustration, the following incident
occurred at a dinner table, at which many were present.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Sitting beside Fuseli was a very garrulous, shallow young
man, who several times misquoted the great dramatist.
After receiving blunder upon blunder with an audible growl,
he addressed the young gentleman with, “Where’s that to
be found?”</p>

<p>“In Titus Andronicus, where the black, as you recollect,
says—”</p>

<p>“No, saar, I do not recollect; I do not think it is in Taitus
Andronicus at all.”</p>

<p>“Macbeth, perhaps,” ventured the quoter.</p>

<p>“No, no; it is not in Maac-beath.”</p>

<p>“In Hamlet.”</p>

<p>“No, nor in Haamlet, saar.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I do not recollect where it is,” admitted the
speaker. To which Fuseli added, “Perhaps you do not
know, but it is in Otello, saar,” much to the diversion of the
assembled guests.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c40"><i>NOISY STUDENTS.</i></p>

<p>Hearing a violent noise in the studio, and inquiring the
cause, he was answered by one of the porters, “It’s only
those fellows, the students, sir.” “Fellows!” exclaimed
Fuseli; “I would have you to know, sir, those <i>fellows</i> may
one day become Academicians.” The noise increasing, he
opened the door with, “You are a den of wild beasts.”
Munro, who was one of the students, bowed, and said,
“And Fuseli is our keeper.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c41"><i>THE YORKSHIREMAN.</i></p>

<p>Discoursing one day upon the merits of Phocion, the
Athenian, a gentleman gravely put the question, “Pray, sir,
who was Mr. Phocion?” Fuseli as gravely answered, “From
your dialect, sir, I presume you are from Yorkshire; and, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
so, I wonder you do not recollect Mr. Phocion’s name, as
he was Member for your county in the Long Parliament!”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c42"><i>RICHARDSON’S NOVELS.</i></p>

<p>A gentleman speaking one day in the presence of Fuseli,
of books, remarked, “No one now reads the works of
Richardson.” “Do they not?” said the painter, “then by
G— they ought. If people are tired of old novels, I should
be glad to know your criterion of books. If Richardson is
old, Homer is obsolete. <i>Clarissa</i> to me is pathetic; I
never read it without crying like a child.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c43"><i>CLASSICAL ATTAINMENTS.</i></p>

<p>Haydon, in his lectures on painting, observes: “In general
literature, what is called polite literature, Fuseli was highly
accomplished. He perhaps knew as much of Homer as
any man; but he was not a deep classic; he could puzzle
Dr. Burney by a question, but he was more puzzled if Dr.
Burney questioned him. Porson spoke lightly of his knowledge
of Greek, but in comparison with Porson, a man
might know little and yet know a great deal; a friend once
asked him to construe a difficult passage in the chorus in the
Agamemnon of Æschylus—he cursed all choruses, and said
he never read them! But his power of acquiring, idiomatically,
a living language was certainly extraordinary; six weeks, he
said, was enough for him to speak any language; yet though
his tendency to literature gave him in society the power of
being very amusing, I think it my duty to caution the young
men present; he, for an artist, allowed literature to take too
predominant a part in his practice, and sunk too much the
painter in the critic.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c44"><i>GAINSBOROUGH (THOMAS), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS eminent landscape painter was born at Sudbury,
in Suffolk, in 1727. His father was a clothier by
trade, and of very peculiar habits. It was to his mother, an
accomplished woman, that he owed so much affectionate
encouragement during his boyhood. He often absented
himself from school, and spent the time sketching the
picturesque dwellings with overhanging storeys in his neighbourhood.
It has been said of him, “Nature was his
teacher, and the woods of Suffolk were his Academy.” His
affection for his birthplace was very great throughout his
career, and there was not a tree of any beauty there that
was not treasured in his memory. At the age of fifteen he
left for London, and returned disappointed to Sudbury after
four years’ absence. On his return to his native town he
devoted himself to the study of landscape, and soon after
married the handsome Margaret Burr, who brought an
annuity of £200. Still he studied hard, and his fame
extended. It was in 1774, after thirty-three years, he
returned to the metropolis, his fame having long preceded
him. With a splendid income, he occupied Schomberg
House, Pall Mall, at a rental of £300 a year. Here there
was much demand upon his industry by royalty, peers, and
commoners. He died in August, 1788, in the sixty-second
year of his age.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c45"><i>THE CONCEITED ALDERMAN.</i></p>

<p>Gainsborough was one day painting the portrait of a rich
citizen, who told the painter that he had come in his new
five-guinea wig. His manner and his attempts to look pretty
had such an effect upon the artist, it was with the greatest
difficulty he was prevented laughing in his face. At length,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
when the worthy alderman begged he would not overlook
the dimple in his chin, his manner was so simpering that no
power of his face could withstand it; Gainsborough burst
into an immoderate fit of laughter, threw his pencils on the
floor, and d—ning the dimple, declared he could not paint
that or the alderman either, and never touched the picture
more.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c46"><i>THE ARTIST’S INDEPENDENCE.</i></p>

<p>A gentleman being disappointed at not receiving his
picture, called upon the painter, and inquired of the porter
in a loud voice, “Has that fellow, Gainsborough, finished my
portrait?” He was shown into the studio, where he beheld
his portrait, and was much pleased with it. After ordering
the artist to send it home forthwith, he added, “I may as
well give you a cheque for the other fifty guineas.” “Stay
a minute,” said Gainsborough, “it just wants a finishing
stroke;” and snatching up a background brush, he dashed
it across the smiling features, indignantly exclaiming, “Sir,
where is my fellow now?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Siddons sat for her portrait to Mr. Scott, of North
Britain, who observed, the nose gave him great trouble.
“Ah!” said the great actress, “Gainsborough was a good
deal troubled the same way. He had altered and varied
the shape a long while, when at last he threw down the
pencil, exclaiming, ‘D—n the nose! there is no end to it.’”
The pun was applicable, as that lady had a long nose.</p>

<p>A neighbour, having his garden robbed on several occasions,
could never hit upon the thief. It happened one
morning early, the painter, then a mere boy, walked in the
garden sketching, when he observed a man pop his head
over the garden wall. Being unobserved, the young artist
had sufficient time to sketch the robber’s head, and from
its accuracy, on showing it to a neighbour, the fellow was
immediately recognised as living in the neighbourhood, and
was accordingly apprehended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>


<p class="c sp" id="c50"><i>THE GERMAN PROFESSOR.</i></p>

<p>The painter gave all the hours of intermission in his
profession to fiddles and rebecs. His musical taste was
very great; and he himself thought he was <i>not intended by
nature for a painter, but for a musician</i>. Happening to see
a theorbo in a picture of Vandyke’s, he concluded it must
be a fine instrument. He recollected to have heard of a
German professor; and, ascending to his garret, found him
dining on roasted apples, and smoking his pipe, with his
theorbo beside him. “I am come to buy your lute—name
your price, and here’s your money.” “I cannot sell my
lute.” “No, not for a guinea or two;—but you must sell
it, I tell you.” “My lute is worth much money—it is worth
ten guineas.” “Aye, that it is!—see, here’s the money.”
So saying, he took up the instrument, laid down the price,
went half-way downstairs, and returned. “I have done but
half my errand; what is your lute worth if I have not
your book?” “What book, Master Gainsborough?”
“Why, the book of airs you have composed for the lute.”
“Ah, sir, I can never part with my book!” “Pooh! you
can make another at any time—this is the book I mean—there’s
ten guineas for it; so, once more, good day.” He
went down a few steps, and returned again. “What use is
your book to me if I don’t understand it?—and your lute—you
may take it again if you won’t teach me to play on it.
Come home with me, and give me the first lesson.” “I will
come to-morrow.” “You must come now.” “I must
dress myself.” “For what? You are the best figure I have
seen to-day.” “I must shave, sir.” “I honour your
beard.” “I must, however, put on my wig.” “D—n
your wig! Your cap and beard become you! Do you
think if Vandyke was to paint you, he’d let you be shaved?”</p>

<p>Having to attend as a witness in an action brought by
Desenfans against Vandergucht, both devotees to art, the
painter was asked by the cross-examining counsel whether
he did not think there was something necessary besides the
eye to regulate an artist’s opinion respecting a picture?
“I believe,” replied Gainsborough, “the veracity and
integrity of a <i>painter’s eye</i> is at least equal to a <i>pleader’s
tongue</i>.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c52"><i>GORDON (SIR JOHN WATSON), R.A.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>IR J. W. GORDON was born in Edinburgh in 1788. He
was intended by his father, Captain Watson, for the
Engineers, but pending arrangements for his entering that
service he was allowed to attend the Trustees’ Academy,
under Graham, where he showed so much promise, that it
was decided he should try his skill as an artist. In 1808
he sent a picture of a subject from “The Lay of the Last
Minstrel” to the first public exhibition of paintings in
Edinburgh, which was opened in that year; and contributed
to most of the exhibitions held since. Never having studied
or been abroad, he received his education in the art from
the celebrated Graham, master of Wilkie, Allan, and others.
In 1826, he assumed the name of Gordon for the purpose, it
is said, of distinguishing his paintings from the other Watsons,
who contributed at that time to the Edinburgh Exhibition.
He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1827, and was
elected Associate in 1841. In 1850, he was unanimously
chosen President of the Royal Scottish Academy, appointed
Limner to Her Majesty, and received the honour of knighthood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
The next year he was elected a Royal Academician.
His industry at his art was continued till within a few weeks
of his death, on 1st June, 1864, aged seventy-six years.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c53"><i>LORD PALMERSTON AND THE ARTIST.</i></p>

<p>“It was before I had a name,” said Mr. Gordon, looking
round the room in true story-teller style. “I had exhibited
for several years, but without any particular success. One
year, however—the year before I painted ‘The Corsicans’—Lord
Palmerston took a sudden fancy to my picture, called
‘Summer in the Lowlands,’ and bought it at a high figure.
His lordship at the same time made inquiries after the artist,
and invited me to call upon him. I waited upon his lordship
accordingly: he complimented me upon the picture;
but there was one thing about it he could not understand.
‘What is that, my lord?’ I asked. ‘That there should be
such long grass in a field where there are so many sheep,’
said his lordship promptly, and with a merry twinkle of the
eye. It was a decided hit this; and having bought the
picture and paid for it, he was entitled to his joke. ‘How
do you account for it?’ he went on, smiling, and looking
first at the picture and then at me. ‘Those sheep, my lord,’
I replied, ‘were only turned into that field the night before
I finished the picture.’ His lordship laughed heartily, and
said, ‘Bravo!’ at my reply, and gave me a commission for
two more pictures; and I have cashed since then some
very notable cheques of his—dear old boy!”—<i>Belgravia

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c54"><i>HARLOWE (GEORGE HENRY).</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>ARLOWE, the painter, was born in the parish of St.
James’s, Westminster, in 1787. He was a posthumous
child, but his mother took great care of his education,
and allowed him to follow the bent of his inclination
for the arts, which he studied, first under Drummond, and
next under Sir Thomas Lawrence. He was dismissed by
Sir Thomas in consequence of claiming as his own a picture
Sir Thomas employed him to dead colour. He revenged
himself by painting a caricature of Lawrence’s style on a
signboard at Epsom, and signed it, “T. L., Greek St., Soho.”
On leaving Sir Thomas’s employ, Harlowe made arrangements
and started for Italy. Previous, however, to his going
abroad, he painted some historical pictures of great merit,
particularly one of Henry VIII., Queen Catherine, and
Cardinal Wolsey. During his residence at Rome in 1818,
he made a copy of Raphael’s “Transfiguration,” and executed
a composition of his own, which was exhibited by
Canova, and afterwards at the academy of St. Luke’s. He
died soon after his return to England, January 28, 1819.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c55"><i>TAKING A LIKENESS UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</i></p>

<p>Harlowe was very eccentric, and not a little affected. He
used to go to dinner parties in the dress of a field-officer,
and he was always ambitious of being taken for a military
man. John Kemble disliked the man and his affectations so
much, that he refused, even at the request of Sir Thomas
Lawrence, to sit to Harlowe, giving as his only reason—“I
do not like that man.” Harlowe was engaged at this time
on his celebrated picture of Queen Catherine, and finding
the grave actor persisted in his refusal to sit, he went to the
theatre when Kemble played Wolsey, and seating himself in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
front of the stage-box, made sketches of his face in every
change of its expression, and from them composed the likeness
in the picture, which, it is needless to say, is the best
portrait of Kemble ever painted. Harlowe used afterwards
to say, in speaking of this, “By G—, I painted that portrait
so well out of revenge.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c56"><i>HAYDON (BENJAMIN ROBERT).</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">B</span >ENJAMIN ROBERT HAYDON was born on the
25th January, 1786. In common with most true
artists, young Haydon early displayed an overpowering love
for art. One of his most favourite studies is said to have
been drawing the guillotine, with Louis taking leave of the
people. At the age of thirteen he was taken to the grammar
school at Plympton—the same at which Sir Joshua Reynolds
was educated. From thence he was sent to Exeter, to study
book-keeping, and at the end of six months was bound to
his father for seven years. Within a short time of his signing
his indentures, it was evident to both his father and his
friends that young Haydon would never do as a tradesman.
After much dissuasion, and against all remonstrance, Haydon
collected his books and colours, packed up his things,
and started for London, in May, 1804. He took lodgings
at 342, Strand, and for nine months he saw nothing but his
books, his casts, and his drawings. He was introduced by
Prince Hoare to Northcote, Opie, and Fuseli; and it was
the latter who got the young artist into the Academy.
While studying at the Academy he became acquainted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Sachom and Wilkie. In 1807, Haydon’s first picture of
“Joseph and Mary resting on the road to Egypt,” appeared.
About this time his devotion to his art was very close. He
rose as soon as he woke—be it three, four, or five,—when
he would draw at anatomy until eight; in chalk from nine
till one, and from half-past one till five; then walked, dined,
and to anatomy again from seven to ten and eleven. Wilkie
had obtained for the young artist a commission from Lord
Mulgrave for “Dentatus.” Having delayed the painting
some months, Haydon in 1808 removed his lodgings to 41,
Great Marlborough Street, when he began the noble lord’s
commission in earnest. In this year he first saw the Elgin
marbles, and he thus expresses his admiration of them: “I
felt the future; I foretold that they would prove themselves
the finest things on earth—that they would overturn the
false <i>beau ideal</i>, where nature was nothing, and would establish
the true <i>beau ideal</i>, of which nature alone is the basis. I felt
as if a divine truth had blazed inwardly upon my mind, and
I knew they would at last rouse the art of Europe from its
slumber in the darkness.” His “Dentatus” brought him a
prize of one hundred guineas from the British Institution.
His next picture, “Macbeth,” he was not so successful with,
and did not get the prize that the painter had expected:
to make things worse, he relieved himself by quarrelling with
the Academy and painting “Solomon.” He then began
that system of getting into debt, which was the curse of his
whole after-life. His usual companions were Hazlitt, the
Hunts, Barnes (of the <i>Times</i>), Jackson, Charles Lamb, and
John Scott. His “Solomon” was so far a success, that it
was sold for six hundred guineas. Also the British Institution
voted one hundred guineas to him as a mark of their
admiration of this picture. In 1820 he finished his celebrated
picture “Entry of Christ into Jerusalem.” By exhibiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
this picture in town, Haydon made a clear profit of
£1298. He then set to work to finish his picture “Christ
in the Garden,” and to sketch his “Lazarus:” the latter he
determined should be his grandest and largest work. Having
recently married, he wrote on the last day of 1821 as
follows: “I don’t know how it is, but I get less reflective as
I get older. I seem to take things as they come, without
much care. In early life everything, being new, excites
thought. As nothing is new when a man is thirty-five, one
thinks less. Or, perhaps, being married to my dearest
Mary, and having no longer anything to hope in love, I get
more contented with my lot, which, God knows, is rapturous
beyond imagination. Here I sit sketching, with the loveliest
face before me, smiling and laughing, and solitude is not.
Marriage has increased my happiness beyond expression.
In the intervals of study, a few minutes’ conversation with a
creature one loves is the greatest of all reliefs. God bless
us both! My pecuniary difficulties are still great; but my
love is intense, my ambition intense, and my hope in God’s
protection cheering.” But the remainder of the painter’s
life—25 years—was one dark cloud, here and there relieved
by momentary rays of sunshine. Always in debt; always in
danger; always pestered by lawyers and arrests. It has been
with truth observed, that upon one half of Haydon’s income,
many a better man than he had lived. In 1835 we find
him lecturing at Mechanics’ Institutions in the provinces,
which for a time was a pecuniary success. But he was too
deeply involved in the expensive fashions and gaieties of
May Fair; and again we find him in the King’s Bench.
Three more years of fearful struggle brought him to the
fearful tragedy which shocked the country on the 22nd of
June, 1846. Having returned from an early walk, Haydon
entered his painting-room, and wrote in his diary:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p class="c">
“God forgive me! Amen.<br>
Finis<br>

<p class="c more">‘Stretch me no longer on the rough world.’—<i>Lear.</i></p>

<p class="c">
End of twenty-sixth volume.”
</p>

<p>“Before eleven,” says Tom Taylor, “the hand that wrote
it was stiff and cold in self-inflicted death.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c57"><i>INTRODUCTION TO FUSELI.</i></p>

<p>“Calling at Fuseli’s house,” says Haydon, “the door
was opened by the maid. I followed her into a gallery or
show-room, enough to frighten anybody at twilight. Galvanized
devils; malicious witches, brewing their incantations;
Satan bridging Chaos, and springing upwards, like
a pyramid of fire; Lady Macbeth, Carlo and Francisco,
Falstaff and Mrs. Quickly—humour, pathos, terror, blood
and murder, met one at every look. I expected the floor
to give way: I fancied Fuseli himself to be a giant. I
heard his footsteps, and saw a little bony hand slide round
the edge of the door, followed by a little white-headed, lean-faced
man, in an old flannel dressing-gown, tied round the
waist with a piece of rope, and upon his head the bottom
of Mrs. Fuseli’s work-basket. ‘Well, well,’ thought I, ‘I
am a match for you at any rate, if bewitching is tried;’ but
all apprehension vanished, on his saying in the mildest and
kindest way, ‘Well, Mr. Haydon, I have heard a great deal
of you from Mr. Hoare. Where are your drawings?’ In
a fright, I gave him the wrong book, with a sketch of some
men pushing a cask into a grocer’s shop. Fuseli smiled,
and said, ‘Well, de fellow does his business at least with
energy!’ I was gratified at his being pleased in spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
my mistake.... He (Fuseli) was about five feet five
inches in height, had a compact little form, stood firmly at
his easel, painted with his left hand, never held his palette
upon his thumb, but kept it upon his stone, and being very
near-sighted, and too vain to wear glasses, used to dab his
beastly brush into the oil, and sweeping round the palette
in the dark, take up a great lump of white, red, or blue, as
it might be, and plaster it over a shoulder or a face.
Sometimes in his blindness he would make a hideous smear
of Prussian blue on his flesh, and then perhaps, discovering
his mistake, take a bit of red to darken it; and then,
prying close in, turn round and say, ‘Ah, dat is a fine
purple! It is really like Correggio;’ and then, all of a sudden,
he would burst out with a quotation from Homer, Tasso,
Dante, Ovid, Virgil, or perhaps the Niebelungen Lied,
and thunder round with ‘Paint dat!’... I found him,”
continues Haydon, “the most grotesque mixture of literature,
art, scepticism, indelicacy, profanity and kindness: he
put me in mind of Archiman, in Spenser. Weak minds he
destroyed. They mistook his wit for reason, his indelicacy
for breeding, his swearing for manliness, and his infidelity
for strength of mind; but he was accomplished in elegant
literature, and had the art of inspiring young minds with
high and grand views.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c58"><i>LONDON SMOKE.</i></p>

<p>Haydon observed to Fuseli: “So far from the smoke of
London being offensive to me, it has always been to my
imagination the sublime canopy that shrouds the city of
the world. Drifted by the wind, or hanging in gloomy
grandeur over the vastness of our Babylon, the sight of it
always filled my mind with feelings of energy, such as no
other spectacle could inspire.” “Be Gode,” added Fuseli,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
“it’s like the smoke of the Israelites making bricks.” “It
is grander,” rejoined the other; “for it is the smoke of a
people who would have made the Egyptians make bricks for
them.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c59"><i>HAYDON’S DESCRIPTION OF THE BRITISH SCHOOL<br>
OF PAINTERS.</i></p>

<p>“Never were four men so essentially different as West,
Fuseli, Flaxman, and Stothard. Fuseli’s was undoubtedly
the mind of the largest range; West was an eminent
<i>macchinista</i> of the second rank; Flaxman and Stothard
were purer designers than either. Barry and Reynolds
were before my time; but Johnson said, in Barry’s ‘Adelphi’
‘there was a grasp of mind you found nowhere else,’
which was true. Though Fuseli had more imagination and
conception than Reynolds, though West put things together
quicker than either, though Flaxman and Stothard
did what Reynolds could not do, and Hogarth invented a
style never thought of before in the world, yet, as a great
and practical artist, in which all the others were greatly
defective, producing occasional fancy pictures of great
beauty, and occasional desperate struggles in high art, with
great faults, Reynolds is unquestionably the greatest artist
of the British School, and the greatest artist in Europe
since Rembrandt and Velasquez.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c60"><i>HAYMAN (FRANCIS), R.A.</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>RANCIS HAYMAN was born in Exeter in the year
1708. He studied under Mr. Robert Brown, portrait
painter. He has been described as meriting the honour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
being placed at the head of the English School of Historical
Painters. By his agreeable manners he became intimate
with the <i>bon vivants</i> of the age in which he lived. Being
introduced to Fleetwood, the then manager of Drury Lane,
he painted his scenes, and after the manager’s death
married his widow. In Pasquin’s “Royal Academicians,”
we have the following remarks upon this painter, “In the
great point of professional taste, Hayman could not be
arranged as exemplary. Yet I have many doubts if taste
is in any instance wholly intuitive; and am inclined to
think that we acquire taste by the progressive movements
of early perception, which, by frequent subtle inroads upon
the mind, make, in the issue, an establishment, and give
a system and a hue to thought. We may discover original
genius in a savage, but never any symptom of that correct
association of idea and action which constitute that practical
excellence which we denominate taste.” Hayman died
February 2nd, 1776.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c61"><i>GLUTTONY.</i></p>

<p>Hayman was noted for his eating. When an apprentice,
he and his fellow apprentices (some of whose appetites were
but little inferior) used to dine at a public-house in the
neighbourhood of the Mansion House. Instead of declining
to treat with them, the shrewd landlord used to observe, “I
should be absolutely ruined by those young painters, but for
one circumstance, which is, that their extraordinary appetites
have become objects of great celebrity and curiosity
in this quarter of the City, where we are such judges of
those things: the consequence of which is that every day
we have a gormandizing exhibition, and my house is full of
spectators to see the Great Eaters: the company then retire
to my other rooms to talk the matter over; conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
produces thirst; and therefore I make up by the sale of
my liquor for my loss by the devastation of my edibles.
Long life to the painters, I say! May their appetites increase
with the diminution of what they feed on!”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c62"><i>MARQUIS OF GRANBY AND THE NOBLE ART.</i></p>

<p>Being of a lively temper and attached to boxing, the
painter frequently recommended the “noble art” to his
sitters, in order to give a vivacity to the features. While
painting the picture of the celebrated Marquis of Granby,
also an admirer of the stimulating exercise with the gloves,
the invitation was given and accepted for a few rounds, and
at it they went. The contest soon grew warm, and the
uproar soon attracted all the inmates of the house, who,
much alarmed, rushed into the room, and beheld the
pugilistic peer and painter rolling about and mauling each
other like enraged bears. Pictures, palettes, the easel, and
the other furniture of an artist’s room, were scattered in dire
confusion. A few minutes sufficed to smooth their ruffled
feathers, and replace the furniture; after which the marquis
took his place in high spirits, and Hayman gave the finishing
touch to the picture.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c63"><i>THE PAINTER’S FRIENDSHIP FOR QUIN.</i></p>

<p>In 1755, Hayman etched a small quarto plate of Quin,
the actor, in the character of <i>Falstaff</i>, seated on a drum in a
swaggering attitude, with his right elbow resting upon the
hilt of his sword, by the side of the body of <i>Hotspur</i>.
Quin and Hayman were inseparable friends, and so convivial
that they seldom parted till daylight. One night,
after “beating the rounds,” and making themselves gloriously
drunk, they attempted, arm in arm, to cross a kennel, into
which they both fell. When they had remained there a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
minute or two, Hayman, sprawling out his shambling legs,
kicked Quin. “Holloa! what are you at now?” stuttered
Quin. “At? why, endeavouring to get up, to be sure,”
replied the painter; “for this don’t suit my palate.” “Pooh!”
replied Quin, “remain where you are; the watchman will
come by shortly, and he will take us both up.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c64"><i>HOGARTH (WILLIAM).</i></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ILLIAM HOGARTH, who has been called “The
Painting Moralist,” was born in London, in 1697.
His father was a fine scholar, and his chief dependence was
from the produce of his pen; and the son testifies to “the
cruel treatment his father met with from booksellers and
printers.” In his anecdotes of himself, he says: “Besides
the natural turn I had for drawing, rather than learning
languages, I had before my eyes the precarious situation of
men of classical education.... It was, therefore, conformable
to my own wishes that I was taken from school,
and served a long apprenticeship to a silver-plate engraver.”
It was during his apprenticeship, about the year 1717, he
executed a small oval illustration of Pope’s <i>Rape of the Lock</i>,
which was much praised, and brought the young artist many
admirers. The following year, his apprenticeship having
expired, he entered the Academy in St. Martin’s Lane, and
studied drawing from the life. He supported himself by
engraving for the booksellers, and by all accounts a very
hard time he had of it. In 1721, his father died “of an
illness,” the son says, “occasioned partly by the treatment
he received from this sort of people (booksellers), and partly
by disappointment from great men’s promises.” And in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
another place he complains, “But here, again, I had to
encounter a monopoly of printsellers, equally mean and
obstructive to the ingenious; for the first plate I published,
called the <i>Taste of the Town</i>, in which the reigning follies
were lashed, had no sooner begun to take a run, than I
found copies of it in the print-shops, vending at half-price;
and I was thus obliged to sell the plate for whatever these
pirates pleased to give me, as there was no place of sale
but at their shops.” And thus, until nearly thirty years of
age, this great genius earned hardly enough to maintain himself.
It was in the year 1723 that the artist first turned his
attention to the stage, and discovered his real genius in his
satirical talents. After one or two caricatures his genius
was quickly recognised, and his adverse circumstances were
at an end. In 1726 he invented and engraved the set of
twelve large prints for <i>Hudibras</i>. He married, in 1729, the
daughter of Sir James Thornhill, the painter, though without
Sir James’s consent; but, after two years, seeing the
rising reputation of the young painter, and at the earnest
entreaties of others, the offended parent forgave the couple.
Being reconciled with Sir James, Hogarth took up his brush
and began portrait painting. About this time he says of
himself: “I married and commenced painter of small
conversation-pieces, from twelve to fifteen inches high.
This, having novelty, succeeded for a few years. But though it
gave somewhat more scope for the fancy, it was still but a less
kind of drudgery; and as I could not bring myself to act like
some of my brethren, and make it a sort of manufactory, to
be carried on by the help of backgrounds and drapery
painters, it was not sufficiently profitable to pay the expenses
my family required. I therefore turned my thoughts to a
still more novel mode—to painting and engraving modern
moral subjects—a field not broken up in any country or any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
age.” His first painting is said to have been a representation
of Wanstead Assembly, painted for Lord Castlemaine;
which, meeting with much favourable notice, led him to
painting portraits. This part of the profession was not at
all suited to the artist’s peculiar genius; though Nichols
says of Hogarth’s attempts: “He was not, however, lucky
in all his resemblances, and has sometimes failed where a
crowd of other artists have succeeded.” After surprising
the country with the production of his great genius as an
artist for many years, in 1753 he appeared in the character
of author, and published a quarto volume entitled, “The
Analysis of Beauty, written with a view of fixing the
fluctuating Ideas of Taste.” Wherein he shows, by a
variety of examples, that a curve is the line of beauty, and
round swelling figures are most pleasing to the eye. Walpole,
commenting upon this production from the pen of the artist,
observes: “It has many sensible hints and observations;
but it did not carry the conviction, nor meet the universal
acquiescence he expected. As he treated his contemporaries
with scorn, they triumphed over this publication, and
irritated him to expose him. Many wretched burlesque
prints came out to ridicule his system. There was a better
answer to it in one of the two prints that he gave to
illustrate his hypothesis. In the ball, had he confined himself
to such outlines as compose awkwardness and deformity,
he would have proved half his affection; but he has added
two samples of grace in a young lord and lady, that are
strikingly stiff and affected. They are a Bath beau and a
country beauty.” It should be added that neither as artist
nor author did Hogarth ever receive flattery from the pen
of the courtly Walpole. Hogarth died on the 25th October,
1764.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>
<p class="c sp" id="c65"><i>WILKES AND CHURCHILL.</i></p>

<p>In Mr. Thomas Wright’s work, “England under the House
of Hanover,” that writer thus describes the caricature drawn
upon the artist by his quarrel with Wilkes and Churchill:—</p>

<p>“They hold him up now as the pensioned dauber of the
unpopular Lord Bute, and the calumniator of the friends of
liberty. In one entitled, ‘The Beautifyer: a Touch upon the
Times,’ Hogarth is represented upon a huge platform, daubing
an immense <i>boot</i> (the constant emblem of the obnoxious
minister), while, in his awkwardness he bespatters Pitt and
Temple, who happen to be below. This is a parody on
Hogarth’s own satire on Pope. Beneath the scaffold is a
tub full of Auditors, Monitors, etc., labelled ‘The Charm:
Beautifying Wash.’ A print entitled ‘The Bruiser Triumphant,’
represents Hogarth as an ass, painting the Bruiser,
while Wilkes comes behind, and places horns on his head,—an
allusion to some scandalous intimations in the <i>North
Briton</i>. Churchill, in the garb of a parson, is writing
Hogarth’s life. A number of other attributes and allusions
fill the picture.</p>

<p>“A caricature entitled ‘Tit for Tat’ represents Hogarth
painting Wilkes, with the unfortunate picture of Sigismunda
in the distance. Another, ‘Tit for Tat, Invt. et del. by G.
O’Garth,—according to act or order is not material,’ represents
the painter partly clad in Scotch garb, with the line of
beauty on his palette, glorifying a boot surmounted by a
thistle. The painter is saying to himself, ‘Anything for
money: I’ll gild this Scotch sign, and make it look glorious;
and I’ll daub the other sign, and efface its beauty, and make
it as black as a Jack Boot.’ On another easel is a portrait
of Wilkes, ‘Defaced by order of O’Garth, and in the foreground
‘a smutch-pot to sully the best and most exalted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
characters.’ In another print, ‘Pug, the snarling cur,’ is
being severely chastised by Wilkes and Churchill. In
another he is baited by the bear and dog; and in the background
is a large panel, with the inscription, ‘Panel-painting.’
In one print, Hogarth is represented going for his
pension of £300 a year, and carrying as his vouchers the
prints of ‘The Times,’ and Wilkes, ‘I can paint an angel
black, and the devil white, just as it suits me.’ ‘An answer
to the print of John Wilkes, Esq.,’ represents Hogarth
with his colour-pot, inscribed ‘Colour to blacken fair
characters;’ he is treading on the cap of liberty with his
cloven foot; and an inscription says, ‘£300 per annum for
distorting features.’</p>

<p>“Several other prints equally bitter against him, besides a
number of caricatures against the Government, under the
fictitious names of O’Garth, Hoggart, Hog-ass, etc., must
have assisted in irritating the persecuted painter.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c66"><i>GARRICK’S GENEROSITY.</i></p>

<p>The following anecdote of the mode by which the great
actor became possessed of some of Hogarth’s celebrated
pictures has been vouched as genuine: the pictures consisted
of <i>The Entertainment</i>, <i>The Canvass</i>, <i>The Poll</i>, and <i>The
Chairing</i>. “When Hogarth had finished them, he went to
Garrick, with whom he was on very intimate terms, and told
him he had completed them; adding, ‘It does not appear
likely that I shall find a purchaser, as I value them at two
hundred guineas; I therefore intend to dispose of them by
a raffle among my friends, and I hope you will put down
your name.’ Garrick told him he would consider of it, and
call on him the next day. He accordingly did so, and having
conversed with Hogarth for some time, put down his
name for five or ten guineas, and took his leave. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
scarcely got into the street, when (as Mrs. Garrick, from
whom the story is derived, stated) he began a soliloquy to
the following effect: ‘What have I been doing? I have just
put down my name for a few guineas at Mr. Hogarth’s request,
and as his friend; but now he must still go to another
friend, and then to another: to how many must he still
apply before he gets a sufficient number? This is mere
begging; and should such a man as Hogarth be suffered to
beg? Am I not his friend?’ The result was, that he instantly
turned back, and purchased those fine pictures at
the price of 200 guineas, which the artist himself had fixed.”
Hogarth’s principal object in painting them, like his other
great works, was for the purpose of copying them by engravings.
They were published by subscription at two
guineas the set. For the first plate of <i>The Entertainment</i> he
had 461 subscribers at 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and for the three others
only 165 subscribers; so that there were 296 names to the
first who did not subscribe to the other three.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c67"><i>CARICATURE.</i></p>

<p>On a lady expressing a wish to Hogarth to learn the secret
of caricature, he replied, with much earnestness, “Alas!
young lady, it is not a faculty to be envied. Take my advice
and never draw caricature: by the long practice of it I
have lost the enjoyment of beauty. I never see a face but
distorted; I never have the satisfaction to behold the
human face divine.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c68"><i>WILKES.</i></p>

<p>Writing to his friend Churchill, Wilkes says: “I take it
for granted you have seen Hogarth’s print against me. Was
ever anything so contemptible? I think he is fairly <i>felo de
se</i>. I think not to let him off in that manner, although I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
might safely leave him to your notes. He has broken into
my pale of private life, and set that example of illiberality
which I wished—of that kind of attack which is ungenerous
in the first instance, but justice in the return.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c69"><i>HOGARTH’S CONCEIT.</i></p>

<p>At a dinner party Hogarth was told that Mr. John Freke
had asserted that Dr. Maurice Greene was as eminent in
musical composition as Handel. “That fellow Freke,” said
Hogarth, “is always shooting his bolt absurdly, one way or
another. Handel is a giant in music; Greene only a light
Florimel kind of composer.” “Aye,” rejoined the other,
“but at the same time Mr. Freke declared you were as good
a portrait painter as Vandyke.” “<i>There</i> he was right,”
replied the artist; “and so, by G—, I am,—give me my
time, and let me choose my subject.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c70"><i>AN UGLY SITTER.</i></p>

<p>It happened, in the early part of Hogarth’s life, that a
nobleman, who was uncommonly ugly and deformed, came
to sit to him for his picture. It was executed with a skill
that did honour to the artist’s abilities; but the likeness was
rigidly observed, without even the necessary attention to
compliment or flattery. The peer, disgusted at this counterpart
of his dear self, never once thought of paying for a
reflector that would only insult him with his deformities.
Some time was suffered to elapse before the artist applied
for his money; but afterwards many applications were made
by him (who had then no need of a banker) for payment,
without success. The painter, however, at last hit upon an
expedient, which he knew must alarm the nobleman’s pride,
and by that means answer his purpose. He sent him the
following card:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Hogarth’s dutiful respects to Lord ——; finding
that he does not mean to have the picture which was drawn
for him, is informed again of Mr. H.’s necessity for the
money; if, therefore, his lordship does not send for it in
three days, it will be disposed of, with the addition of a
tail, and some other little appendages, to Mr. Hare, the
famous wild-beast man; Mr. H. having given that gentleman
a conditional promise of it for an exhibition picture, on his
lordship’s refusal.”</p>

<p>This intimation had the desired effect. It was sent home
and committed to the flames.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c71"><i>HOPPNER (JOHN), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>OHN HOPPNER was born in London, in the year
1759. In the earlier part of his life, it was his good
fortune to associate with some of the most brilliant
characters of the age. He applied himself closely to the
study of the works of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and was, in many
points, successful in imitating that celebrated portrait-painter’s
beauties. On his first using the brush, he is described
as possessing much confidence, with little ability.</p>

<p>Edward Dayes, in his “Modern Artists,” in estimating the
works of Hoppner, says:—</p>

<p>“This artist is the best of all the imitators of Sir Joshua,
and would deserve great praise, were his pictures his own;
but so far is that from being the case, that they are composed
from the prints of Reynolds; and the attitudes of the sitters
made to answer as well as circumstances will permit. It is
truly astonishing that any one can lose sight of the charms
of that great mistress of the art, Nature, and tread servilely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
in the footsteps of any man, however exalted his rank. The
loss of ambition is a sure sign of the decline of the arts;
as, where every one is content to follow, no one will get
before. When a great man appears, weak minds are apt to
seek for the rules of art in his works, instead of applying to
Nature: this is precisely the case of this artist; he has not
a wish, or an inquiry to make, that does not end in Reynolds,—forgetting
the old proverb, that when two men ride
on a horse, one must be behind. His colouring is clear
and bright, his handling free; his small pictures are by far
the best.”</p>

<p>Hoppner died in Charles Street, St. James’s Square, on
the 23rd January, 1810.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c72"><i>AN ECCENTRIC CUSTOMER.</i></p>

<p>The following humorous anecdote is given in the <i>Literary
Gazette</i>, 1826, as related by Hoppner, to his friend Coombe:
A loyal banker dropped in upon the painter, to <i>negociate</i>
for a family picture. It happened in the memorable epoch
of “<i>life and property men</i>,” when London was to be thatched
with silver, and paved with gold. “Well, sir, your most
obedient, Mister Painter,” said the squire banker, looking
around, “Sir, yours,” returned the painter, bowing low.
The banker was a fine, portly, pompous-looking citizen, a
good subject to his Majesty, and no bad subject as a sitter,
though it happened that he sat not. “Well, Mister Painter,
sir, you have some fine pieces here, sir. Pray sir, a—what
may be the value of that?” pointing to a whole length of an
admiral. “My price for that is two hundred guineas.” “So!”
ejaculated the banker; “a fine, noble-looking fellow, ’pon my
word—very heroical indeed! Ah! Mister Painter, they are
our great <i>wooden walls</i>, our prime <i>bull-works</i>. This is the
land for such seamen—old England, hey, sir! and those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
who don’t like it, why let ’em leave it: that’s my toast, sir.
But to the point, sir: my business is to negociate, look you,
for a large family piece,—myself, my wife, and my boys and
girls; a fine family, as you shall see, sir,—the same number
as his Majesty’s, God bless him! Now, what is your charge
for such a collection?—<i>group</i>, I think you painters call it.”
“I cannot exactly answer that, within five hundred pounds
or so,” replied the painter. “Wheugh-h-h!” whistled the
banker. “What, sir, five hundred pounds?” “Such a subject
requires study, sir, great studying—as how——” “Pooh!
pooh! study, Mister Painter? true, sir, but you have not
studied <i>Cocker</i>, sir, hey? ha, ha, ha!” “Why, sir, such a
work requires consideration. I should like first to be allowed
to see your family, sir—and then—how to dispose of so
many persons—how to employ them, and—and—” “Oh,
my good sir, I’ll save you that trouble; that is already
settled, my good sir:—we are to be painted on our lawn,
with a harpsichord, and all singing <i>God save the King</i>.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c73"><i>THE ALDERMAN’S LADY.</i></p>

<p>From a volume of the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, 1826, we extract
the following: “There are faces,” Hoppner observed,
“without features, and features without faces.” An alderman’s
lady says, “La! Mr. Hoppner, Sir John looks too grave.”
“Why, madam, ’tis the only way to make a sitter escape
looking like a fool.” “But why not make Sir John smile?”
“A <i>smile</i> in painting is a <i>grin</i>, and a <i>grin</i> is a <i>growl</i>, and a
growl is a bite—and I’ll not alter it,” said the half-mad,
irritable painter; “and if ever I paint another subject, short
of a Lord Mayor, I’ll be d—d!”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c74"><i>A COOL SITTER.</i></p>

<p>Hoppner was commissioned to paint a certain pompous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
personage, one of the cabinet of the king. The great man
could not condescend to attend any painter; so it was to
be taken at the great man’s house. It was to be a <i>whole
length</i>. “Well, sir,” quoth the Right Honourable, as Mr.
H. made his bow, “I have no time, <i>sar</i>, to give to your art,
a—unless you can take a scheme of me at my breakfast.” The
repast was already laid,—a steaming urn, coffee-pot, toast,
rolls, muffins, chickens, and ham. The limner spread his
arcana, and commenced to paint, as the great man commenced
his <i>déjeûné</i> by supplying his appetite with half a
muffin, and a cut from the wing of a pullet, together with a
slice of ham. This accomplished, and sipping his tea,
without condescending to notice the artist, he seized the
newspaper, took his reading-glass from his bosom, began
dictating to his private secretary, gave orders to his cook for
dinner, dictated again, sipped his tea; and with the cup
hiding his chin, and the newspaper his cheek, pompously
exclaimed, “I desire, Master Hoppner, that you proceed.”
“I am going,” replied the indignant artist, who, stalking out
of the room, left the great man all astounded at the haughty
demeanour of a portrait painter.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>ULIUS CÆSAR IBBETSON was born at Scarborough,
in Yorkshire, in 1759; was apprenticed to a ship
painter at Hull, and at an early age came to London, and
practised his art. He painted landscapes, cattle, and some
historical pieces. Benjamin West appropriately called him
the Berghem of England; yet, like many other men of
great ability, his genius was no match for poverty. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
Redgrave, in “A Century of Painters of the English School,”
says: “He was one of the jolly companions of George
Morland: like him he lived from hand to mouth; was
employed by an inferior class of picture dealers, and made
them his pot companions.” He published a whimsical
book entitled “Humbugalogia,” in which he fully exposed
the ignorance and tricks of professed picture dealers.
Among other rather coarse, but very forcible, illustrations
which it contained, was one to the following effect: “These
people say they have a great love for the fine arts. Yes;
just such a love as a butcher has for a fat ox.” After
quitting London, this clever artist resided for some years in
the lake districts of Westmoreland, which he left to settle at
Masham. In 1817, whilst engaged in painting a favourite
hunter of Lady Milbank’s, he took cold, which settled on
his lungs, and terminated his existence on the 13th October,
1817.</p>

<p>According to “Notes and Queries” (vol. viii. <span class="allsmcap">N.S.</span>, p. 96),
there is a local tradition that whilst Ibbetson was residing
at Ambleside, he used often to ramble as far as the picturesque
valley of Troutbeck, which is about four miles
from Ambleside, to indulge in the double enjoyment of the
sweet scenery around, and the “home brewed” within the
humble ale-house there; and that, in commendation of the
latter, he painted a sign with two faces, each “looking the
character” admirably: the one being that of a stout, jolly-faced
toper with rubicund nose, and the other that of a thin,
white-faced, lantern-jawed teetotaler; and with labels from
their mouths thus inscribed:—</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c77"><i>THE RECOGNITION.</i></p>

<p>Ibbetson’s abilities attracted the notice of M. de Loutherbourg,
who introduced him to Mons. Desenfans, of pictorial
memory. An invitation to breakfast placed Ibbetson and
Loutherbourg in Mons. Desenfans’ parlour, the walls of
which were covered with <i>chefs d’œuvre</i> of art; and the
judgment of the young painter was tried on the merits of
the several masters. When coming to one which seemed to
attract Ibbetson’s particular regard, Mons. Desenfans
observed: “That, Mr. Ibbetson, is a very beautiful example
of David Teniers.” There was a pause, Mons.
Desenfans requested Ibbetson’s opinion; whose answer,
after another pause, was: “That picture, sir?—that picture
I painted!” Here was confusion worse confounded. The
collector had been taken in: his judgment had been committed.
The murder, however, was out; marks and circumstances
proved the fact beyond doubt. The good-natured
Loutherbourg endeavoured to “take up his mangled matter
at the best:”—“He had frequently been deceived.” Nay,
he went further, and told how, in his younger days, he had
himself manufactured a few old masters. Whether or not
this apology mended the business, we know not; but certain
it is that poor Ibbetson was never again asked to breakfast
with Mons. Desenfans.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c78"><i>INMAN (HENRY).</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>ENRY INMAN was born at Utica, New York, 20th
October, 1801. His parents were English. His
father removed to the city of New York, in 1812, at which
early date Inman’s taste for drawing was manifested, and
cultivated to a certain extent at the day-school he attended.
The arrival of Wertmuller’s picture of <i>Danæ</i>, about the
year 1814, first suggested the art to him as a profession. It
was exhibited at Mr. Jarvis’s rooms, in Murray Street, and
Inman gives the following account of his second visit to it:—</p>

<p>“On a second visit, when I went alone, I saw Mr. Jarvis
himself, who came up from his painting room into the
apartment in which the <i>Danæ</i>, with other works of art, were
placed. On observing his entrance, with maulstick in
his hand, and palette on his arm, I removed my hat and
bowed, presuming that he was the master of the establishment.
At that time I regarded an artist with peculiar
reverence. Without noticing my salutation, he walked
rapidly towards me, and, with his singular look of scrutiny,
peered into my face. Suddenly he exclaimed, ‘By heavens,
the very head for a painter!’ He then put some questions
to me; invited me below stairs, and permitted me to examine
his portfolios. He shortly after called upon my father, and
proposed to take me as a pupil. I was at this time preparing
for my entrance to the West Point Institution, as a
cadet, for which I had already obtained a warrant. My
father left the matter to myself, and I gladly accepted Mr.
Jarvis’s proposal. I accordingly entered upon a seven
years’ apprenticeship. Notwithstanding his phrenological
observations upon my cranium, a circumstance connected
with my first effort in oil colours would seem to contradict
his favourable inference. Another of his students and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
myself were set down before a small tinted landscape, with
instructions to copy it. Palettes and brushes were put into
our hands, and to work we went. After much anxious
looking and laborious daubing, Mr. Jarvis came up to see
what progress we had made. After regarding our work for
some moments in silence, he astounded us with these words:
‘Get up! get up! These are the most infernal attempts
I ever saw. Here, Philip! [turning to a mulatto boy, who
was grinding paints in another part of the room], take the
brushes, and finish what these gentlemen have begun so
bravely!’ All this took place in the presence of several
strangers, who had come to look at the gallery. You can
imagine what a shock our self-love received. Such mortifications
are the most enduring of all remembrances. Notwithstanding
this rebuff, I managed to make other and more
successful efforts.”</p>

<p>At the expiration of his apprenticeship, he married Miss
O’Brien, and began business for himself as a portrait and
miniature painter. It is stated that in this latter branch he
was very successful, although he afterwards entirely abandoned
it. On his removal to Philadelphia he painted a
portrait of Mr. Rawle for the members of the bar of that
city. At this gentleman’s house he saw a copy of Stuart’s
celebrated portrait of Washington, of which he mentions the
following anecdote:—</p>

<p>“Mr. R. informed me, while we were looking at the head
of Washington, that on one occasion, when that great man
dined at his house, he sat immediately beneath the picture,
and that position gave Mr. R. ample opportunity to satisfy
himself of the correctness of the resemblance. I was
much pleased with this testimony in favour of its truth, as
of late years an attempt has been made to impeach the
justice of Stuart’s representation of Washington.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>In the midst of his success, Inman appears to have been
discontented with city life; and throughout the journal which
he kept, “intended,” as he says, “for the reception of
miscellaneous notes on passing events,” we find interspersed,
longings for the green fields. In a letter to a friend, he
says: “I have always panted to live in the country, where I
can be surrounded by something pleasanter to look upon
than the everlasting brick walls of a city; ... and moreover,
I shall then be better enabled to withdraw myself
gradually from mere face-making: to practise in the more
congenial departments of art—namely, landscape and historical
painting.”</p>

<p>He suffered much from attacks of asthma, which visited
him in the summer or autumn of every year, until his death.
In 1841 he was attacked with more violence than he ever
experienced before, and he describes his suffering with
characteristic cheerfulness. He speaks of the grinding
agony he endured as his “bosom fiend,” and compares it
with the “vulture gnawing into the vitals of Prometheus.”</p>

<p>In February, 1842, we find him one of the guests at a
dinner given to Mr. Chas. Dickens, at the Astor House;
on which occasion Mr. Inman made a speech, from which it
will be seen, though so great and so recent a sufferer from
his complaint, he still retained his cheerful social qualities.
The following is a part of the speech referred to:—</p>

<p>“I would invite your attention, sir, in the first place, to
the great value which the arts of design must attach to the
peculiar literature of the author we delight to honour in
the person of our cherished guest; insomuch as it affords
so many admirable themes for pictorial illustration. The
great schools of art, of painting in particular, are divided
into the classical, the romantic, and the picturesque, the last
of which is by far the most popular and most cultivated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
this department of taste. The two first appeal for their
sources of interest to associations connected with the history
of the remote past; but the latter addresses itself to every
feeling that links us to ‘the world we live in,’ with all its
thrilling contrasts of happiness and misery, of vice and
virtue.</p>

<p>“Mr. President, I will venture to claim for the writings of
Mr. Dickens, in especial manner, this attribute of the picturesque.
He has sought and found, in the humble walks
of life, those unequalled scenes of pathos, of humour, and of
sentiment, which so eminently characterize his productions.
Passing by the abodes of wealth, luxury, and rank, where
the passions are all concealed beneath the mask of cold
convention, he has flashed the light of his genius upon the
gloomy haunts of squalid poverty and suffering virtue, the
dark dens of reckless guilt and crime, until every salient
point of interest is revealed in a thousand glowing objects
of contemplation to the student of morals, of human
nature, and of art.</p>

<p>“Another quality which enhances the analogy which I
have attempted to establish, is to be found in the graphic
force of his delineations. For all the purposes of fame, his
fictitious personages have already become intense realities.
For instance: who does not firmly believe that those charming
people, Messrs. Winkle, Tupman, Snodgrass &amp; Co., are
at this moment ‘Pickwicking’ it about London in veritable
flesh and blood? Let me ask who that wears a heart does
not weep over the memory of poor Nell, as over one we
have known and loved in actual life?</p>

<p>“In conclusion, this picturesqueness, this artistic power,
will, perhaps, sanction the parallel I have introduced in
the toast I now beg leave to offer. I will give you, sir,
the ‘Boz’ gallery of written pictures—may Charles Dickens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
long live to add new master-pieces to the imperishable collection!”</p>

<p>On New Year’s Day, 1843, the following singular medley
of mirth and melancholy is entered in his diary: “Stayed
home all day. The zest and cream of life are gone. Two
hundred thousand dollars and travelling would revive me—nothing
else; ditto fishing.” On the 3rd January, he writes:
“Fine prospect of starving to death this year. Not a soul
comes near me for pictures. Ambition in art is gone. Give
me a fortune, and I would fish and shoot for the rest of my
life, without touching a brush again.”</p>

<p>In 1844 he came to England, when he was engaged to
paint the portraits, among others, of Dr. Chalmers and
Wordsworth. With respect to his visit to the latter, Inman,
in a letter to a friend, says: “Mary and I had a very pleasant
time in Westmoreland, I can assure you; fine weather,
glorious scenery, and a very kind reception from the great
poet. Mr. Wordsworth, who is now a hale old man of 75
years, accompanied me on one or two of my sketching
excursions, for which I feel highly honoured, as he is not
only a good poet, but a most intelligent and long-headed
man in conversation.... I heard from Mr. Carey, of
Philadelphia, who wishes me to paint for him the portrait of
the celebrated writer, the Rt. Hon. Thos. B. Macaulay, M.P.,
instead of the fancy piece originally ordered, I have heard
from the great man, and he, in a very complimentary note,
has consented to sit in about five weeks. I shall then come
up to London again for this purpose.”</p>

<p>Having finished the portrait of Macaulay, he thus writes
to a friend:—</p>

<p>“You would have laughed to-day, could you have stood
by and heard the courteous battle-royal of words which took
place between me and my sitter—the witty, learned, and all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
accomplished Mr. Macaulay, M.P. He is fond of taking
the other side of the argument, even though ’tis paradoxical.
He loves to differ and defend his difference, and he wields a
well polished, logical Toledo, I can tell you! He is too well
read and too intelligent to entertain many of the absurd
opinions respecting our country and its institutions that are
so rife in the English newspaper press: but still I find he
loves to bring on a discussion of some one or other of those
puzzling questions that belong to our side of the water,
namely, state-sovereignty, repudiation, slavery, etc. I congratulate
myself upon having met in him one of those persons
of renown for brilliant writing, whose attainments as poet,
scholar, and reviewer, cause him to stand amongst the
highest in modern English literature. Will you believe it?
<i>Noodle</i> as I am, and albeit unused to the controversial mood,
I rather flatter myself that ‘this child’ held his own in the
fight! One touch of fence I used (and ’tis a custom I am
generally fond of) was never directly to answer a Socratic
query, but always to evade it, by begging him to state his
position affirmatively. It worked to a charm. However,
we had a delightful sitting of it. Only think! I had double
duty to perform—namely, <i>fight</i> with the <i>inside</i> of his head,
and <i>paint</i> the <i>outside</i> of it!”</p>

<p>In his letters from this time to that of his death, which
took place in January, 1846, he constantly expresses the
greatest anxiety respecting his pecuniary affairs. He found
some professional employment, but barely enough to meet
his expenses. He died of disease of the heart. He left a
wife and five children. His kindness of heart, his intellectual
attainments, his social accomplishments, his conversational
power, his brilliant imagination, and his technical ability,
were eulogized by the newspapers of all classes throughout
the country.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c79"><i>JERVAS (CHARLES).</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>HARLES JERVAS was born in Ireland, in the year
1675, and studied under Sir Godfrey Kneller. By the
generosity of a friend he was enabled to visit France and
Italy, where he gave himself up to hard study in his art, and
on his return to England his talent was soon recognised, and
he became very popular. The line he chose was portrait
painting. He also discovered considerable ability in literature.
He published a translation of <i>Don Quixote</i>; to which
translation the celebrated Dr. Warburton added an appendix
on the origin of Romances and of Chivalry. Jervas also
gave instruction in the art of painting to Pope, with whom
he was very intimate, and who has handed him down to
posterity in his works. “Jervas was the last best painter
Italy had sent us,” Pope used to observe. Jervas was also
patronized by William and Queen Anne. He died on 3rd
November, 1739.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c80"><i>SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS.</i></p>

<p>Burnet relates that when Reynolds’s sister asked him the
reason why we never see any of the portraits of Jervas now,
he replied, “Because, my dear, they are all up in the garret.”
Yet, this man rode in his chariot and four, and received the
praises of Pope in verse.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c81"><i>DR. ARBUTHNOT.</i></p>

<p>Jervas, who affected to be a free-thinker, was one day
talking very irreverently of the Bible; Dr. Arbuthnot maintained
to him that he was not only a speculative but a
practical believer. The painter denied it: Arbuthnot said
he would prove it. “You strictly observe the second commandment,”
said the doctor; “for in your pictures you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
make not the likeness of anything that is in the heavens
above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the
earth.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c82"><i>VANITY.</i></p>

<p>There is a very amusing anecdote of the painter’s inordinate
vanity, contained in the <i>Percy Anecdotes</i>. The artist having
succeeded happily in copying a picture of Titian, he looked
first at the copy, and then at the original, and then with
parental complacency exclaimed, “Poor little Tit! how he
would stare!”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c83"><i>LADY BRIDGEWATER.</i></p>

<p>Being employed to paint the portrait of Lady Bridgewater,
one of the greatest beauties of the age, he fell desperately in
love with her. So deeply was his imagination smitten with
the features of her enchanting face, that he reproduced them
in all his portraits; and many a female was most agreeably
surprised on discovering her unexpected resemblance to
Lady Bridgewater. His love, however, was not so strong as
his vanity, which he more than once displayed, even in the
presence of his mistress. One day when she was sitting to
him, he stopped short, and expatiated on her charms with
all the enthusiasm of a lover; “But yet,” continued he, “I
am forced to acknowledge that you have not a handsome
ear.” “Have the goodness,” replied the lady, “to show
me what you call a handsome ear.” “Here is one,” said
Jervas, shoving aside his wig, and showing his own.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c84"><i>THE PAINTER’S GENEROSITY.</i></p>

<p>Jervas one day entered the shop of Carter, the statuary, in
May Fair, and inspected a collection of models, etc. Carter
was very industriously employed at the lowest branches of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
his profession, such as chiselling tombstones, grave-slabs,
etc. After remaining a short time, Jervas commended his
industry, and took his leave, apparently much pleased with
the models, etc. A few days after Jervas called again, and
after a few general observations, asked whether Carter was
married, and whether he had any children. Being answered
in the affirmative to both questions, he said bluntly, “Do
you want any money, Mr. Carter?” “Want money? Lord
love me! yes, I believe I do.” “Would a hundred pounds
be of service to you?” “A hundred pounds! Why it
would be the making of me for ever.” Jervas thereupon
requested him to breakfast with him at his house the following
morning. At the hour appointed Jervas received him
with much politeness, and while at breakfast said, “Mr.
Carter, I have for some time observed you as a young man
of considerable talents and unremitting industry, and I am
happy that Providence has put it into my power to assist
your efforts. Here is the hundred pounds you seemed to
think would be of service to you.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c85"><i>HINTS TO POPE ON PAINTING.</i></p>

<p>There is an anecdote of Pope wishing to study painting,
and applying to his friend Jervas for instruction in the art.
Jervas readily consented, and having to leave town for a few
days, gave the key of his painting-room to the poet, promising
on his return to give his candid opinion on what Pope
had done, and also suggest to him hints. On Jervas’s return,
after making many general remarks on the Art, Pope
interrupted him: “You tell me what I ought to do, but you
have not given me your opinion of my picture. I know it’s
very bad, and it gets worse and worse every day. I am
sure it looked a deal better three or four days ago. Tell me
the reason of this, and why the paint peels off in some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
places.” Jervas replied—“Colours change in drying; they
get duller; some more, some less. Greens fade a great deal.
Asphaltum gets much darker and heavier. Of the rest
we should make allowance for these changes; so that the
picture should not seem right when first painted, but should
sink, fade, or dry to the hues required. The reason it peels
off is, you have painted a coat of colour over an under one
before it has dried and hardened, and the force of your brush
thus rubbed it off. You should go over your colours as little
as possible. A painter ought to study the natures of colours—have
some knowledge of chemistry—should know what
colours are transparent, and how much so—what are opaque,
and what dry soon, such as umber; and what won’t, such
as lake, brown-pink, etc. These last should be mixed with
drying oil. All colours made from vegetables, such as
lake and brown-pink, are apt to fly: all from metals, such
as white lead and verdigris, are apt to change: but all
earths, such as ochre, amber, etc., stand well. Clean your
palette, when done with, with spirits of turpentine; also your
brushes: and try to paint without dirtying yourself with the
colours. The knowledge of and attention to a number of
trifles, such as these, contributed to give Titian, Rubens,
and Rembrandt, so much advantage over those who do not
study such things.”</p>

</div>


<h2 class="nobreak" id="c86"><i>KNELLER (SIR GODFREY).</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>IR GODFREY KNELLER was born at Lubeck about
1648. He was intended for the army; but his genius
for painting being discovered, he was placed under Bol, at
Amsterdam, after which he received instructions from
Rembrandt. In 1672 he went to Italy; and while at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
Venice, painted the portraits of some families of distinction.
From thence he came to England by the way of Hamburgh,
and was employed to paint a portrait of Charles II., at the
same time with Lely, who candidly bestowed praise upon
his performance. This success fixed Kneller at the English
court, where he painted seven sovereigns; besides three
foreign ones. His principal patron was William III., who
conferred on him the honour of knighthood, and engaged
him to paint the Hampton Court beauties. His pencil was
also employed on several of the pictures of the admirals in
that palace, and the Kit-Cat Club. George I. created him
a baronet. He was a man of wit, but excessively vain, as
appeared in his gift of five hundred pounds to Pope, to
write an extravagant epitaph for his monument in Westminster
Abbey. He died very rich in 1723.—<i>Walpole’s
Anecdotes.</i></p>


<p class="c sp" id="c87"><i>ROYAL PATRONAGE.</i></p>

<p>The ten sovereigns whom Kneller painted were the
following: Charles II., James II., and his queen, William
and Mary, Anne, George I., Louis XIV., the Czar Peter the
Great, and the Emperor Charles VI.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c88"><i>DR. RADCLIFFE.</i></p>

<p>Sir Godfrey, when living next door to the famous Dr.
Radcliffe, granted him permission to make a door into the
painter’s garden, where there was a beautiful variety of
flowers. But the physician’s servants taking unbecoming
liberties on Kneller’s premises, he had to complain to their
master. After many fruitless remonstrances Sir Godfrey sent
his man one day to let the physician know that he should
be obliged to brick up the passage; to which the cynic
replied, with his accustomed asperity, “Let him do what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
will with the door, except painting it.” The servant was at
first unwilling to communicate the exact answer, but Kneller
insisted on knowing it, and retorted, “Did my good friend
say so? Then you go back and tell him that I will take
anything from him but his physic.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c89"><i>ORIGIN OF THE KIT-CAT CLUB.</i></p>

<p>This club is said to have been founded by Jacob Tonson,
the bookseller. However this may have been, he was
certainly their secretary. He was an active man at all their
meetings, and as a testimony of the good disposition of his
illustrious friends towards him, they each presented him with
their portraits. These were painted by Sir Godfrey Kneller.
The club is reported to have derived its title from the
name of the person at whose house the meetings were first
held. This was one Christopher Cat, an obscure pastry-cook,
who lived originally in Shire Lane, Temple Bar, but
subsequently at the Fountain Tavern, Strand. The standing
dish at supper was mutton pies: for the manufacture of
which Mr. Cat had acquired considerable reputation. A
different etymology of the club’s name has been assigned by
Arbuthnot. In the following epigram, he seems to refer it
to the custom of toasting ladies after dinner, peculiar to those
gentlemen:—</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c90"><i>PORTRAIT PAINTING.</i></p>

<p>Sir Godfrey, who was principally eminent as a portrait-painter,
after a long discourse upon the various schools of
painting, concluded with, “Painters of history make the dead
live, and do not themselves live till they be dead; I paint
the living, and they make me live.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c91"><i>CUT AT POPE.</i></p>

<p>The artist’s consciousness of his own skill was so well
known that it exposed him frequently to the banter and
irony of the wits, his friends. Pope, to pay him off, said to
him after looking round a room full of beauties he had
painted, “It’s a pity, Sir Godfrey, that you had not been
consulted at the creation.” The artist threw his eyes strong
upon Pope’s shoulders, and answered, “I should have made
some better things.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c92"><i>A COUNTRY SITTER.</i></p>

<p>A certain country family, whose reason for coming to town
was the intention of having their pictures drawn, and principally
that of the hopeful heir, brought him to the artist.
Seeing that a little converse with the world would soon wear
off his awkward rusticity, instead of drawing him in a green
coat with spaniels, or in the more contemptible livery of a
fop playing with a lapdog, the painter gave him a soul darting
with proper spirit through the rusticity of his features. A
gentleman met the mother and sisters coming down stairs
the day it was finished, and found Sir Godfrey in a violent
rage above: “Look there,” said he, pointing to a picture,
“there is a fellow! I have put some sense into him, and
none of his family know him.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c93"><i>VANDYKE AND KNELLER.</i></p>

<p>There was a period, observed Sir Joshua Reynolds, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
to name Vandyke in competition with Kneller was to incur
human contempt. The character of the eighteenth century
in England resembled that of the seventeenth in Italy.
It was the age of English mediocrity, the reaction of that
powerful burst of national genius that was developed by the
civil wars and the revolution.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c94"><i>TONSON, THE BOOKSELLER.</i></p>

<p>Kneller was very covetous, very vain, and a great glutton.
Tonson, the bookseller, got many pictures from him, it is related,
by playing these passions against the other. He would
tell the great painter that he was the greatest master that
ever was, and send him every now and then a haunch of
venison and a dozen of claret. “Oh!” said Kneller once to
Vandergucht, “this old Jacob loves me; he is a very good
man: you see he loves me, for he sends me good things,
the venison was fat!” Kneller would say to Cock, the
auctioneer, “I love you, Mr. Cock, and I will do you good;
but you must do something for me too, Mr. Cock; one
hand can wash the face, but two hands wash one another.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c95"><i>LAWRENCE (SIR THOMAS), P.R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HOMAS LAWRENCE was born in the city of Bristol,
in May, 1769. He was the youngest of a family of sixteen
children, and was remarkable from his infancy for his
winning manners. His father took much pains in teaching
the child passages from the poets, and at five years old he
could repeat any speech in Milton’s <i>Pandemonium</i>. The
child was equally clever with his pencil; observing which, a
Derbyshire baronet, struck with the boy’s genius, offered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
send him to Rome at an expense of £1000, but his father
replied that “his son’s talents required no cultivation.” At
so young an age of five years his drawings of eyes were so
good as to make Fuseli remark with enthusiasm: “But, by
G—t, he paints eyes better than Titian!” In 1785, young
Lawrence received the Society of Arts Medal with five
guineas for the most successful copy from the old masters,
being a crayon drawing of the “Transfiguration” of Raphael;
he also received “the greater silver palette gilt,” by special
vote of the committee. Having become a student of the
Royal Academy at the age of eighteen, he sent in the year
1787 the extraordinary number of seven pictures; in the
following year he sent six portraits; thirteen in 1789, and
twelve pictures in 1790. At the express desire of His Majesty,
Lawrence was admitted an Associate of the Royal Academy,
by the suspension of a law against the admission of an
Associate under the age of twenty-four. Although supported
by Sir Joshua Reynolds, his election was much opposed by
several academicians. Shortly before Lawrence’s return in
1820 from Rome, where he had been engaged on the great
work of painting the Allied Sovereigns, Benjamin West, the
President of the Royal Academy, died full of honours.
Lawrence was unanimously chosen to succeed him, and the
King, in approval of the choice, added a superb gold chain
and medal of himself. In addition to the honour of knighthood
by the Prince Regent, and admission to the Academy
of St. Luke, in Rome, he became, in 1817, a member of the
American Academy of the Fine Arts. He was elected by
the Academy of Florence, a member of the first class. The
Academy of Venice added their election in 1823; that of
Bologna followed; and Turin in 1826. He was also elected
a member of the Imperial Academy at Vienna, and received
the diploma of the Danish Academy; and finally made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
chevalier of the Legion of Honour, in France. He died on
the 7th January, 1830.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c96"><i>ROYAL FAVOURS.</i></p>

<p>Lawrence received many valuable presents from foreign
princes and nobles, as marks of admiration of the great
painter’s genius: the following list was made out by his
sister,—</p>

<p>“By the King of France (Charles X.), in the autumn
of 1825, he was presented with the Legion of Honour
(the medal or jewel of which is in my son John’s possession);
a magnificent French clock, nearly two feet high;
two superb green and gold china jars; and a dessert set of
Sèvres porcelain, which Sir Thomas left to the Royal
Academy.</p>

<p>“By the Emperor of Russia, a superb diamond ring, of
great value.</p>

<p>“By the King of Prussia, a ring, with His Majesty’s
initials, F. R., in diamonds.</p>

<p>“He likewise received presents from the foreign ministers
assembled at Aix-la-Chapelle, where he painted all of them;
from the Archduchess Charles and Princess Metternich at
Vienna; from the Pope, a ring, and the Colosseum in
mosaic, with his Holiness’ arms over the centre of the
frame; from the Cardinal Gonsalvi, besides other presents,
a gold watch, chain, and seals of intaglios, and many
beautiful bonbonniere boxes of valuable stones set in gold,
gold snuff-boxes, etc.; a fine gold snuff-box from Lord Whitworth,
many years before.</p>

<p>“From the Dauphin, in 1825, a breakfast-set of porcelain,
and a tea-tray painted with the court of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>“By Canova, at Rome, some magnificent casts, valuable
engravings, etc.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>


<p class="c sp" id="c97"><i>MISS FANNY KEMBLE.</i></p>

<p>In a letter to Mr. Angerstein, Lawrence gives his opinion
of this celebrated actress’s successes in the following terms,—</p>

<p>“We have little stirring in town, one novelty excepted,
which enlivens the evenings of this otherwise dull period.
Your respect and regard for Mrs. Siddons and Mr. Kemble
will make you glad to know that the genius and sense of
both are recalled to us by the really fine acting of Miss
Fanny Kemble, the daughter of their brother Charles. She
is not quite nineteen, yet has so satisfied the judgment of the
warmest patrons and ablest critics of the stage, that, in its
worst season, she has drawn full houses (and continues to
draw them) for upwards of twenty-two nights, three nights
in each week, without intermission, to one of Shakespere’s
finest, but certainly most hackneyed plays, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,
and the boxes are already taken to Wednesday se’nnight.</p>

<p>“Her face is not regularly handsome, but she has a fine
and flexible brow, with hair and eyes like Mrs. Siddons in
her finest time. In stature she is rather short, but with such
admirable courage and invariable grace of action, that on the
stage she appears fully of woman’s height. Her voice is at
once sweet and powerful; and blest with a clear ‘Kemble’
understanding (for it is peculiar to her family), she has likewise
fine literary talent, having written a tragedy of great
interest, besides lighter pieces of admirable verse. Her
manner in private is characterized by ease, and that modest
gravity which I believe must belong to high tragic genius,
and which, in Mrs. Siddons, was strictly natural to her;
though, from being peculiar in the general gaiety of society,
it was often thought assumed.</p>

<p>“I have for many years given up the theatre (not going
above once or twice in the year), but this fine genius has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
drawn me often to it, and each time to witness improvement
and new beauties. If she is not taken from the stage, there
is probability that she may remain on it a fine actress for
twenty years, and thus have supported the ascendency of
one family in the highest department of the drama for upwards
of twenty years!”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c98"><i>HOAXING LAWRENCE.</i></p>

<p>Mr. John Bernard, in his “Retrospections of the Stage,”
gives the following anecdote of Lawrence’s cleverness in
sketching likenesses at the early age of nine years:—</p>

<p>“The young artist collected his materials very quickly,
and essayed my visage the first. In about ten minutes he
produced a faithful delineation in crayon, which for many
years I kept as a curiosity. He next attempted Edwin’s,
who, startled at the boy’s ability, resolved (in his usual way)
to perplex him. This he did by changing the form of his
features—raising his brows, compressing his lips, and widening
his mouth. Tom no sooner perceived the change than
he started in supreme wonder, attributing it to a defect in
his own vision. The first outline was accordingly abandoned,
and a second commenced. Tom was now more
particular, and watched him narrowly; but Edwin, feature by
feature, and muscle by muscle, so completely ran, what
might be called the gamut of his countenance (as the
various compartments of its harmony), that the boy drew
and rubbed it out, till his hand fell by his side, and he stood
silently looking in Edwin’s face, to discover, if possible, its
true expression. Edwin could not long maintain his composure
at his scrutiny, and revealed the hoax with a burst of
merriment and mimic thunder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>


<p class="c sp" id="c99"><i>FUSELI’S ENVY.</i></p>

<p>In Lawrence’s great picture of “Satan addressing the
Fallen Angels,” Fuseli complained that the figure of Satan
was his own—that Lawrence had copied some one of his
designs. The following account of the matter, however,
was given by Lawrence in a conversation with Cunningham,
and seems a sufficient explanation:—</p>

<p>“Fuseli, sir, was the most satirical of human beings;
he had also the greatest genius for art of any man I ever
knew. His mind was so essentially poetic that he was
incapable of succeeding in any ordinary object, That figure
of Satan, now before you, occasioned the only interruption
which our friendship of many years’ standing ever experienced.
He was, you know, a great admirer of Milton, from
whom he had many sketches. When he first saw my
Satan, he was nettled, and said, ‘You borrowed the idea
from me!—‘In truth, I did take the idea from you,’ I said;
‘but it was from your person, not from your paintings.
When we were together at Stackpole Court, in Pembrokeshire,
you may remember how you stood on yon high rock
which overlooks the bay of Bristol, and gazed down upon
the sea, which rolls so magnificently below. You were in
raptures; and while you were crying “Grand! Grand!
Jesu Christ, how grand! how terrific!” you put yourself in a
wild posture. I thought on the devil looking into the
abyss, and took a slight sketch of you at the moment: here
it is. My Satan’s posture now, was yours then.’”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c100"><i>HIS PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE.</i></p>

<p>Allan Cunningham gives the following description of the
habits and practice of the great artist:—</p>

<p>“He rose early, and he worked late; for though no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
excelled more in rapid sketches, he had a true enthusiasm
for his art, and would not dismiss hastily anything for which
he was to be paid as a picture. He detained his sitters
often for three hours at a time; had generally eight or nine
of these sittings; and all the while studied their looks
anxiously, and seemed to do nothing without care and consideration.
His constant practice was to begin by making
a drawing of the head, full-size, on canvas, carefully tracing
in dimensions and expression. This took up one day; on
the next he began to paint—touching in the brows, the
nose, the eyes, and the mouth, and finally the bounding
line, in succession. Lawrence sometimes, nay often, laid
aside the first drawing of a head, and painted on a copy.
This was from his fear of losing the benefit of first impressions,
which in such cases are often invaluable. It may be added
that he stood all the while, and was seldom so absorbed in
his undertaking that he did not converse with his sitter,
and feel either seriousness or humour, whilst giving thought
to the brow, or beauty to the cheek. He adhered to the
old rule of receiving half payment at the beginning of a
portrait.</p>

<p>“The distinguished person who favoured him with <i>forty
sittings</i> for his head alone, was Sir Walter Scott. The
picture was painted for George IV., and Lawrence was
anxious to make the portrait the best of any painted from
so celebrated a character.</p>

<p>“At other times, however, he was as dexterous as any
artist. He once told Burnet that he painted the portrait of
Curran in <i>one day</i>: he came in the morning, remained to
dinner, and left at dusk; or, as Lawrence expressed it,
quoting his favourite author</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c101"><i>LIOTARD (JOHN STEPHEN).</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>OHN STEPHEN LIOTARD was born in the year 1702,
at Genoa, At first he studied without instruction, but
in 1715 he visited Paris, and became a pupil of the celebrated
Massé. Here he attracted the notice of the Court painter,
Lemoine, who introduced him to the Marquis Puysieux,
and he afterwards accompanied that nobleman to Naples.
Here he employed himself in painting miniatures on ivory.
He afterwards visited Rome and painted portraits of the
Pope and the Stuart family. In 1738 he accompanied
Lord Duncannon to Constantinople. During his residence
here he allowed his beard to grow, and adopted the Turkish
costume, which he never afterwards relinquished. In 1742<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
he was summoned by the Prince of Moldavia to Jassy, and
after a short time there, proceeded to Vienna, where he was
patronized by the Empress Maria Theresa, who rewarded
him richly for his portraits of the imperial family. He again
returned to Paris, and his magnificent beard and oriental
dress made him for a time the lion of that capital, and
procured him the bye-name of “The Turkish Painter.”
Among the ladies who entrusted him with their portraits was
the celebrated Madame Pompadour, who was by no means
satisfied with the likeness, Liotard having followed nature
so closely as to reproduce even freckles and other accidental
blemishes. From Paris he repaired to London. The best
picture he executed in England was that of the Princess of
Wales and her sons. Perhaps his most popular painting is
that of “The Chocolate Girl,” which is seen on fire-screens,
snuff-boxes, articles of porcelain, etc. In 1756 he visited
Holland, and sacrificed his long-cherished beard on the
altar of Hymen, without, however, laying aside his Turkish
dress. In 1772 he returned to England, painting numerous
portraits, principally in crayons. His works in enamel, etc.,
are very numerous, and are to be found in the various
private and public collections of almost every country in
Europe. He died in the year 1776.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c102"><i>LIVERSEEGE (HENRY).</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>ENRY LIVERSEEGE was born at Manchester, in
September, 1803. Of humble parentage, he was
indebted to the benevolent care of an uncle for a liberal
education. His career as an artist began with copying fine
paintings of old masters. With the exception of a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
visits to London, he passed the whole of his life in his
native town of Manchester. When in London he received
considerable attention from those to whom his genius was
known; among others, from Etty, the R.A. Heath, appreciating
his genius, gave him a commission to paint twelve
subjects for the “Book of Beauty,” which, however, he did
not live to commence. His paintings, which appeared at
the Society of British Artists in London, attracted general
approval and admiration; but in January 1832, before the
completion of his twenty-ninth year, this promising artist
breathed his last.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c103"><i>A DEAR MODEL.</i></p>

<p>“Henry Liverseege had the soul and sense to take nature
for his everlasting model; when he originated, he originated
out of the heart of life; when he illustrated, he made life
sit for his illustrations. In his paintings from Shakspeare,
Scott, Gay, and Butler, and more especially in the more
difficult of them, he always procured living models. Take,
for instance, the two subjects of ‘Christopher Sly and the
Hostess,’ and ‘The Black Dwarf,’ two of his most admirable
paintings: we have it on record that even for these he
found life representatives, and the anecdotes that attach to
each picture are sufficiently amusing. As regards Christopher
Sly, it was long before he could find such a cobbler
as he desired. At length he met with a man he thought
would suit; and, having placed him in his studio, set down
a bottle of gin beside him, saying, ‘Drink whenever you
please.’ The spirit of the cobbler, being one of those that
must lie in sleep some time, and become half corrupted
before it rises, refused to stir; he sat sober as a worshipful
judge upon the bench. Another bottle of gin disappeared
in the same way as the former, but the son of Crispin sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
steady as ever. ‘Begone!’ exclaimed the painter in a
passion; ‘it will cost me more to make you drunk than the
picture will procure me!’</p>

<p>“‘The Black Dwarf,’ it will readily be believed, was a
sort of poser in the way of tumbling upon an original; but
notwithstanding the difficulty of procuring a sitter sufficiently
hideous or misshapen, he at last discovered a miserable
dwarf who afterwards sat to him, and displayed on the
completion of his likeness, great wrath and indignation at
what he considered the malicious mode in which his person
was delineated: he would not believe that it was anything
like <i>him</i>, and left the room unpaid, in high dudgeon,
grumbling hoarsely as far as he could be heard,—for this
fragment of humanity had the voice of a giant.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c104"><i>LOUTHERBOURG (PHILIP JAMES DE),<br>
R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>HILIP JAMES DE LOUTHERBOURG, a distinguished
landscape painter, was born at Strasburg,
in the month of October, 1740. His father, who was a
miniature painter, gave him a superior education. He at
first studied with Tischbein, then under Casanova, who, at
that time, was much admired as an historical painter. But
Loutherbourg’s peculiar <i>forte</i> lay in landscape. He obtained
considerable reputation at Paris, and exhibited his works at
the Louvre. He was admitted a member of the French
Academy in the year 1768. Having come over to England,
he was, in the year 1771, elected a Royal Academician,
and was for some short time engaged as scene-painter at
the Opera House. Soon after his settling in England, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
got up, under the name of the “Eidophusikon,” a novel
and highly interesting exhibition, displaying the changes
of the elements and their phenomena in a calm, by moonlight,
at sunset, and in a storm at sea. This pictorial contrivance
anticipated our present dioramas, although upon a
smaller scale. It has been said of this painter: “His
vigorous style of execution, poetical imagination, and his
perfect knowledge of scenic effect, well qualified him for
a department of art which demands them all, and which
is held to be a subordinate one, chiefly because its productions
are soon laid aside, and entirely forgotten.” He
died at Hammersmith, March 11th, 1812, in his seventy-third
year.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c105"><i>GILRAY.</i></p>

<p>The following is an extract from Holcroft’s Diary:—“Went
with Geiseveiller to see the picture of the ‘Siege
of Valenciennes,’ by Loutherbourg. He went to the scene
of action accompanied by Gilray, a Scotchman, famous
among the lovers of caricature; a man of talents, however,
and uncommonly apt at sketching a hasty likeness. One
of the merits of the picture is the portraits it contains,
English and Austrian. The Duke of York is the principal
figure, as the supposed conqueror; and the Austrian
general, who actually directed the siege, is placed in a
group, where, far from attracting attention, he is but just
seen. The picture has great merit; the difference of costume,
English and Austrian, Italian, etc., is picturesque.
The horse drawing a cart in the foreground has that
faulty affected energy of the French school, which too
often disgraces the works of Loutherbourg. Another picture
by the same artist, as a companion to this, is the
‘Victory of Lord Howe on the 1st of June.’ Both were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
painted at the expense of Mechel, printseller at Basle, and
of V. and R. Green, purposely for prints to be engraved
from them. For the pictures they paid £500 each, besides
the expenses of Gilray’s journeys to Valenciennes, Portsmouth,
etc.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c106"><i>LOUTHERBOURG’S ECCENTRICITY.</i></p>

<p>One day, when he was painting, he observed his footman
driving a poor, half-starved cat out of the area. He immediately
called out, “John, bring the cat back.” “He
was stealing a piece of meat, sir.” “Then he is hungry,
and you must feed him.” “Sir, he has got the mange.”
“Then the animal has a double claim on our commiseration.
Bring him back, and you must feed and cure him
too; and when he is cured, let me see him. I have an
excellent receipt to cure that complaint.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c107"><i>ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING.</i></p>

<p>On another occasion, he was painting a snake pursuing
a traveller, and could not please himself in regard to the
attitude. He rang the bell for John, and, on his appearance,
immediately caught him by the collar. The footman
started back. “Your attitude is excellent,” cried his master.
“That is all I wanted.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c108"><i>OPIE (JOHN), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>OHN OPIE, born May, 1761, was a native of Truro,
in Cornwall, where his father resided in an obscure
situation. Dr. Wolcot took a fancy to the boy, and
finding he had a turn for painting, the doctor employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
him to paint his own portrait, and recommended others.
This employment enabled Opie to save £30, which he
brought to London, and soon became noticed as a genius
of the first order. Success now smiled on his labours.
Through Mrs. Delaney, the young artist was presented
to His Majesty, who bought some pictures of him. In
1786 he was known as an exhibitor at Somerset House,
soon after which he aspired to academical honours. He
accordingly became, first, an Academician Elect, and
then a Royal Academician. When the Royal Institution
was formed, it became necessary that an artist should be
found out who could deliver lectures on the subject of
painting, and Opie was accordingly selected for that purpose.
On the appointment of Fuseli to the office of Keeper
of the Academy, Opie was elected without any difficulty
to the vacant Professorship. He was twice married. The
first was a most unhappy union; for the wife, within a few
years after marriage, encouraged a paramour, which led to
a separation and a lawsuit. His next match was formed
under more propitious circumstances. He became united
to Miss Alderson, of Norwich, who is said to have possessed
a fine taste for poetry and music. There was no
child of either marriage. While enjoying high reputation
in his art, he was suddenly seized with a mortal disease,
and expired April 9, 1807.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c109"><i>THE AFFECTED SITTER.</i></p>

<p>When a lady whose portrait he was painting was mustering
all her <i>smiles</i> to look charming, the irritated artist could
endure the constrained and affected features no longer; but
starting up, and throwing down his brush, exclaimed, in his
broad style, “I tell ye what it is, ma’am, if ye grin so I
canna draw ye.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c110"><i>REYNOLDS (SIR JOSHUA), P.R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>OSHUA REYNOLDS was born in July, 1723. His
father, the Rev. Samuel Reynolds, was much esteemed
for his urbane and benevolent disposition, and possessed
much keen humour. At the early age of eight years, Joshua
gave promise of that genius which in subsequent life gained
him such eminence, and so well entitled him to be regarded
as “the Founder of the British School of Painting.” It
was in 1735, when the young artist was but eleven years
of age, that he painted his first portrait, that of the Rev.
Thomas Smart. This portrait is represented to have been
painted from a drawing taken in church on the artist’s
thumbnail. The celebrated portrait painter, Hudson, had
Joshua for his articled pupil, with whom he received a
premium of £120, and who soon displayed signs of his
after excellence in the line of face painting. He started for
Rome in the year 1749. Afterwards he visited Bologna,
Genoa, Parma, Florence, and Venice, returning to and
establishing himself in England in 1752. From this time
Reynolds had abundant employment, and his celebrity
advanced in proportion. Although since his return from
his travels, Hudson, the former master of Reynolds, with
many others, expressed the opinion that he did not paint
so well as before he left England, they all candidly confessed
within a very short time the error of their opinion. After
enjoying a career of unusual success and prosperity, this
eminent artist, after a long illness, died on the 23rd of
February, 1792, in the 69th year of his age.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c111"><i>ASTLEY.</i></p>

<p>John Astley was a fellow-pupil of Reynolds in the school
of Hudson. They were also companions at Rome. Being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
very poor and proud, Astley suffered much through his
sensitive temperament in trying to conceal from his companions
his narrow circumstances. Being one of a party,
which included Reynolds, on a country excursion, it was
agreed through the heat of the weather to relieve themselves
by walking without their coats. After much persuasion,
poor Astley removed his coat with considerable reluctance,
when it was discovered he had made the back of his waistcoat
out of one of his own landscapes; and his coat being
taken off, he displayed a foaming waterfall, which gave
much mirth to his companions, though to the poor artist
much pain.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c112"><i>REYNOLDS ON ART.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Tucker, Dean of Gloucester, observed in the great
artist’s hearing that a pin-maker was a more useful and
valuable member of society than Raffaelle. “That,” retorted
Reynolds, “is an observation of a very narrow
mind,—a mind that is confined to the mere object of commerce,—that
sees with a microscopic eye but a part of the
great machine of the economy of life, and thinks that small
part which he sees to be the whole. Commerce is the
means, not the end, of happiness or pleasure; the end is a
rational enjoyment by means of the arts and sciences.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c113"><i>JOHNSON’S PORTRAIT.</i></p>

<p>In 1775 Reynolds painted that portrait of Dr. Johnson
which represents him as reading and near-sighted. This
was very displeasing to Johnson, who, when he saw it,
reproved Sir Joshua for painting him in that manner and
attitude, saying, “It is not friendly to hand down to
posterity the imperfections of any man.” But, on the
contrary, Sir Joshua himself esteemed it a circumstance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
in nature to be remarked as characterizing the person
represented, and therefore as giving additional value to
the portrait. Of this circumstance, Mrs. Thrale says,
“I observed that he would not be known by posterity
for his defects only, let Sir Joshua do his worst;” and when
she adverted to his own picture painted with the ear
trumpet, and done in this year for Mr. Thrale, she records
Johnson to have answered, “He may paint himself as deaf
as he chooses, but I will not be <i>Blinking Sam</i>.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c114"><i>REYNOLDS’S SUNDAYS.</i></p>

<p>Sir Joshua was wont to say: “He will never make a
painter, who looks for the Sunday with pleasure, as an idle
day;” and his pocket journals form ample proof that it was
his habit to receive sitters on Sundays as on other days.
This much displeased Dr. Johnson; and Boswell says the
doctor made three requests of Sir Joshua a short time before
his death: one was to forgive him £30, which he had
borrowed of Sir Joshua; another was that Sir Joshua would
carefully read the Scriptures; and lastly, that he would
abstain from using his pencil in future on the Sabbath-day.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c115"><i>DR. JOHNSON.</i></p>

<p>“At the time when Sir Joshua resided in Newport Street,
he, one afternoon, accompanied by his sister Frances, paid a
visit to the Misses Cotterell, who lived much in the fashionable
world. Johnson was also of the party on this tea
visit, and at that time being very poor, he was, as might
be expected, rather shabbily and slovenly apparelled. The
maid-servant by accident attended at the door to let them
in, but did not know Johnson, although he had been a
frequent visitor at the house, he having always been attended
by the man-servant. Johnson was the last of the three that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
came in, when the servant maid, seeing this uncouth and
dirty figure of a man, and not conceiving he could be one
of the company who came to visit her mistresses, laid hold
of his coat just as he was going upstairs, and pulled him
back again, saying, ‘You fellow, what is your business here?
I suppose you intended to rob the house.’ This most
unlucky accident threw poor Johnson into such a fit of
shame and anger, that he roared out like a bull; for he could
not immediately articulate, and was with difficulty at last
able to utter, ‘What have I done? What have I done?’
Nor could he recover himself for the remainder of the
evening from this mortifying circumstance.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c116"><i>GARRICK’S PLEASANTRY.</i></p>

<p>David Garrick sat many times to Reynolds for different
portraits. At one of these sittings he gave a very lively
account of his having sat once for his portrait to an indifferent
painter, whom he wantonly teased; for when the artist
had worked on the face till he had drawn it very correctly,
as he saw it at the time, Garrick caught an opportunity,
whilst the painter was not looking at him, totally to change
his countenance and expression, when the poor painter
patiently worked on to alter the picture, and make it like
what he then saw; and when Garrick perceived that it was
thus altered, he seized another opportunity, and changed
his countenance to a third character, which when the poor
tantalized artist perceived, he in a great rage, threw down
his palette and pencils, saying he believed he was painting
from the devil, and would do no more to the picture.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c117"><i>DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH.</i></p>

<p>Reynolds took snuff so freely when painting, as to cause
much inconvenience to some of his distinguished sitters.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Northcote relates that when the artist was painting the
large picture at Blenheim, of the Marlborough family, the
duchess ordered a servant to bring a broom and sweep
the snuff from off the carpet; but Reynolds desired the
servant to let the snuff remain until he had finished the
painting, observing that the dust raised by the broom would
do more injury to his picture than the snuff could possibly
do to the carpet.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c118"><i>POPE.</i></p>

<p>Reynolds, when seventeen years old, saw Pope at an
auction room. On the celebrated writer’s approach, those
assembled made way and formed an avenue for him to pass
through, which show of respect Pope acknowledged by bowing
several times. He was about four feet six inches in height,
was very humpbacked, wore a black coat, and had on a
little sword. The artist describes him as having a fine eye,
and a long, handsome nose; his mouth had those peculiar
marks which are always found in the mouths of crooked
persons; and the muscles which run across the cheek were
so strongly marked as to appear like small cords.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c119"><i>MICHAEL ANGELO.</i></p>

<p>Reynolds had so great admiration for the genius of M.
Angelo, that he never lost an opportunity of doing justice to
the great Italian’s merits. He thus expressed himself in his
last discourse he delivered at the Royal Academy:—“I feel
a self-congratulation in knowing myself capable of such
sensations as he intended to excite; I reflect, not without
vanity, that these discourses bear testimony of my admiration
of that truly divine man; and I should desire that
the last words which I should pronounce in this Academy,
and from this place, might be the name of Michael
Angelo.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>


<p class="c sp" id="c120"><i>REYNOLDS’S STUDY.</i></p>

<p>Allan Cunningham gives the following:—</p>

<p>“Sir Joshua’s study was octagonal, some twenty feet long,
sixteen broad, and about fifteen feet high. The window was
small and square, and the sill nine feet from the floor. His
sitter’s chair moved on casters, and stood above the floor a
foot and a half. He held his palettes by handles, and the
sticks of his brushes were eighteen inches long. He
wrought standing, and with great celerity. He rose early,
breakfasted at nine, entered his study at ten, examined
designs or touched unfinished portraits till eleven brought
a sitter, painted till four, then dressed, and gave the evening
to company.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c121"><i>DR. JOHNSON’S OPINION OF ARTISTS.</i></p>

<p>Before Johnson’s intimate acquaintance with Reynolds, he
thus writes to his friend, Baretti;—“They (meaning the
artists) please themselves much with the multitude of spectators,
and imagine that the English school will rise in reputation.
This exhibition has filled the heads of the artists
and lovers of art,”—and further on he adds, “surely life, if
it be not long, is tedious, since we are forced to call in the
assistance of <i>so many trifles</i> to rid us of our time,—of that
time which never can return!” When Dr. Johnson became
acquainted and intimate with Reynolds, he was
induced to alter the above opinion, and to highly esteem
the virtues and talents of Sir Joshua, as well as to admire
the Art he professed; for on the third exhibition of the
works of modern artists, Johnson wrote an apologetical
advertisement for the catalogue, at which time the artists
ventured upon the bold experiment of charging one shilling
admittance each person, which has remained the customary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
charge for admission to exhibitions of art to the present
time.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c122"><i>REYNOLDS’S DISCOURSES.</i></p>

<p>On one of the evenings when Sir Joshua delivered his
discourses at the Academy, and when the audience was, as
usual, numerous, and composed principally of the learned
and great, the Earl of C——, who was present, came up
to him, saying, “Sir Joshua, you read your discourse in so
low a tone, that I could not distinguish one word you said.”
To which the president with a smile replied, “That was to
my advantage.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c123"><i>GARRICK’S PORTRAITS.</i></p>

<p>The artist had it long in contemplation to paint a
picture of an extensive composition purposely to display
the various powers of Garrick as an actor. The principal
figure in the front was to have been a full length of
Garrick, in his own proper habit, in the action of speaking
a prologue, surrounded by groups of figures representing
him in all the different characters, by personifying which he
had gained some fame on the stage.</p>

<p>This scheme Sir Joshua described to Garrick at the time
he was painting his portrait; and Garrick expressed great
pleasure when he heard it, and seemed to enjoy the idea
prodigiously, saying, “That will be the very thing I desire;
the only way that I can indeed be handed down to posterity.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c124"><i>SIR JOSHUA’S GENEROSITY.</i></p>

<p>“What do you ask for this sketch?” said Sir Joshua to
an old picture dealer, whose portfolio he was looking over.
“Twenty guineas, your honour.” “Twenty pence, I suppose
you mean?” “No, sir; it is true I would have taken twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
pence for it this morning; but if you think it worth looking
at, all the world would think it worth buying.” Sir Joshua
ordered him to send the sketch home, and gave him
the twenty guineas.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c125"><i>AN EPICURE’S ADVICE.</i></p>

<p>At a venison feast, Sir Joshua Reynolds addressed his
conversation to one of the company who sat next to him,
but to his great surprise could not get a single word in
answer, until at length his silent neighbour, turning to him,
said, “Mr. Reynolds, whenever you are at a venison feast,
I advise you not to speak during dinner-time, as in endeavouring
to answer your questions, I have just swallowed
a fine piece of fat, entire, without tasting its flavour.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c126"><i>LORD MANSFIELD.</i></p>

<p>One day when Lord Mansfield was sitting, Sir Joshua
Reynolds asked him his opinion, if he thought it was a
likeness;—when his lordship replied that it was totally out
of his power to judge of its degree of resemblance, as he
had not seen his own face in any looking-glass during the
last thirty years of his life; for his servant always dressed
him and put on his wig, which therefore rendered it quite
unnecessary for him to look at himself in a mirror.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c127"><i>ROUBILIAC (LOUIS FRANCIS).</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>OUIS FRANCIS ROUBILIAC was born at Lyons,
in France, in the year 1695. By long residence in
England, and the encouragement afforded for the development
of his talents, he is claimed as forming one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
sculptors of the English School. His first public employment
was obtained through the recommendation of Sir
Edward Walpole. This was soon after followed by a
commission to execute the monument of John, Duke of
Argyle, which when finished, was the largest of Roubiliac’s
works. The merits of this monument caused the sculptor
to be patronized widely, and indeed to be more resorted
to than any other in the profession. After an absence from
England on the continent fer a few years,—where he had
been to study some of the great works in sculpture,—he
returned fully sensible of the simplicity and grandeur of
the antique; for on beholding those of his own works,
which had been so highly praised, he is said to have exclaimed,
“Tobacco-pipes, by Jove!” Roubiliac died on
the 11th January, 1762.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c128"><i>GOLDSMITH.</i></p>

<p>Goldsmith had the habit of boasting that he could play
on the German flute as well as most men; and at other
times as well as any man living; but in truth he understood
not the character in which music is written, and played on
that instrument as many others do, merely by ear. Roubiliac
once heard him play, and minding to put a trick
upon him, pretended to be charmed with his performance,
as also that he himself was skilled in the art, and entreated
him to repeat the air that he might write it down. Goldsmith
readily consenting, Roubiliac called for paper and
scored thereon a few five-line staves, which having done,
Goldsmith proceeded to play, and Roubiliac to write; but
his writing was only such random notes on the lines and
spaces, as any one might set down who had ever inspected
a page of music. When they had both done, Roubiliac
showed the paper to Goldsmith, who looked over it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
seeming great attention, said it was very correct, and that
if he had not seen him do it, he never could have believed
his friend capable of writing music after him.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c129"><i>ROUBILIAC’S HONESTY.</i></p>

<p>When a young man in the humble situation of a journeyman
to a person of the name of Carter, Roubiliac had
spent an evening at Vauxhall, and on his return towards
home he picked up a pocket-book containing bank notes to
a considerable amount, also some private papers of consequence
to the owner. He immediately advertised the
circumstance; a claimant soon appeared, who was so struck
with the honest conduct and genius of Roubiliac, that he
promised to befriend him in future. The owner of the
pocket-book was Sir Edward Walpole; and the only present
the honest and gentlemanly pride of the artist would allow
him to receive was a fat buck annually.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c130"><i>BERNINI.</i></p>

<p>On Roubiliac’s return from Rome he paid a visit to Sir
Joshua Reynolds, and expressed himself in raptures on
what he had seen on the continent,—on the exquisite beauty
of the works of antiquity,—and the captivating and luxuriant
splendour of Bernini. “It is natural to suppose,” said he,
“that I was infinitely impatient till I had taken a survey of
my own performances in Westminster Abbey; after having
seen such a variety of excellence, and by G—, my own
work looked to me meagre and starved as if made of nothing
but tobacco-pipes.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c131"><i>LORD SHELBURNE.</i></p>

<p>Roubiliac being on a visit in Wiltshire, happened to take
a walk in a churchyard on a Sunday morning, near Bowood,
just as the congregation was coming out of church. Meeting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
with old Lord Shelburne, though perfect strangers to each
other, they entered into conversation, which ended in an
invitation to dinner. When the company were all assembled
at table, Roubiliac discovered a fine antique bust of
one of the Roman empresses which stood over a side-table.
Whereupon running up to it with much enthusiasm, he
exclaimed, “What an air! what a pretty mouth! what <i>tout
ensemble</i>!” The company began to stare at one another
for some time, and Roubiliac regained his seat; but instead
of eating his dinner, or showing attention to anything about
him, he every now and then burst out in fits of admiration
in praise of the bust. The guests by this time concluding
he was mad, began to retire one by one, till Lord Shelburne
was almost left alone, This determined his lordship
to be a little more particular, and he now, for the first time,
asked him his name, “My name!” replied the other,
“what, do you not know me then? my name is Roubiliac.”
“I beg your pardon,” said his lordship; “I now feel that I
should have known you.” Then calling on the company
who had retired to the next room, he said, “Ladies and
gentlemen, you may come in; this is no absolute madman,
this is M. Roubiliac, the greatest statuary of his day, and
only occasionally mad in the admiration of his art.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c132"><i>DR. JOHNSON.</i></p>

<p>Roubiliac desired of Sir Joshua Reynolds that he would
introduce him to Dr. Johnson, at the time when the doctor
lived in Gough Square, Fleet Street. His object was to
prevail on Johnson to write an epitaph for a monument
on which Roubiliac was engaged for Westminster Abbey.
Sir Joshua accordingly introduced him to the doctor, they
being strangers to each other. Johnson received him with
much civility, and took them up into a garret which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
considered as his library, in which, besides his books all
covered with dust, there was an old crazy deal table, and a
still worse and older elbow chair, having only three legs.
In this chair Johnson seated himself, after having with
considerable dexterity and evident practice first drawn it
up against the wall, which served to support it on that
side on which the leg was deficient. He then took up
his pen and demanded what they wanted him to write.
On this Roubiliac, who was a true Frenchman, began
a most bombastic and ridiculous harangue on what he
thought should be the kind of epitaph most proper for
the purpose, all which the doctor was to write down for him
in correct language; when Johnson, who could not suffer
any one to dictate to him, quickly interrupted him in an
angry tone of voice, saying, “Come, come, sir, let us have
no more of this bombastic, ridiculous rhodomontade, but
let us know, in simple language, the name, character, and
quality of the person whose epitaph you intend to have me
write.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c133"><i>ROUBILIAC’S POETIC EFFUSIONS.</i></p>

<p>At the Exhibition of Works of Art, opened in May,

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c134"><i>RYLAND (WILLIAM WYNNE).</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ILLIAM WYNNE RYLAND was born in London
in the year 1732. He was placed at an early age
under Ravenet, with whom he made much progress in the
art. At the expiration of his apprenticeship he went over
to Paris, and lived with Boucher between four and five
years. On leaving Paris, he started for Rome, where he
studied some time. On his return to England, where his
fame had preceded him, he was welcomed and courted by
all members of his profession. He was soon employed
by the favourite minister, the Earl of Bute, and being
introduced to their majesties, he was honoured by the
appointment of Engraver to the King. To extricate himself
from some embarrassments, he committed an extensive
forgery upon the East India Company, for which he was
tried and executed in the year 1783.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c135"><i>MAGNANIMITY.</i></p>

<p>It is stated of this artist that while awaiting his trial he so
conciliated the friendship of the governor of Bridewell that
he not only had the liberty of the whole house and garden,
but when the other prisoners were locked up of an evening,
the governor used to take Ryland out with him. His friends
concerted a plan by which he was to take advantage of this
indulgence to effect his escape. But when this was mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
to the prisoner he seemed much affected at the
proposal. He protested that if he was at that moment
to meet his punishment, he would embrace it with all its
terrors rather than betray a confidence so humanely given.
This resolution he adhered to, and ultimately preferred the
risk of death to a breach of friendship.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c136"><i>SELF-POSSESSION.</i></p>

<p>On the forgery being discovered, a reward of five hundred
pounds was offered for his apprehension. Large placards
mentioning this high reward, and giving a close description
of his person, were posted all over the town. Ryland had
secreted himself at a friend’s house in the neighbourhood
of Wapping. Notwithstanding that the detectives were all
alert, he would venture out after dark. In crossing Little
Tower Hill, a stranger passed him, turned round, followed,
and confronted him with, “You are the very man I want.”
Ryland, looking him steadily in the face, calmly answered,
“But you are mistaken in your man;” adding, “I have
not the pleasure of knowing you.” The stranger, who
really was looking for some other person, apologised for
his mistake, and resumed his way.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c137"><i>RED CHALK ENGRAVINGS.</i></p>

<p>“Ryland and Picot, a French engraver, who had learned
from Demarteau, in Paris, the mode of stippling in what
was termed the red chalk manner, had brought it over to
England about the year 1770. Demarteau, who was himself
an excellent draughtsman, confined his attempts to the
clever chalk drawings and sketches by Boucher and Vanloo,
of whose Academy figures he produced bold, mellow, and
unrivalled imitations. Ryland and Picot made use of the
stippling to produce elaborate prints from finished pictures.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
Like other easy novelties, it became immediately
the fashion, and for a time gave currency to the languid
elegance of Angelica Kauffman’s designs, who, in return,
extolled the stippling to her courtly patrons. <i>Dilettanti</i>
lords and ladies, the connoisseurs of St. James’s and St.
Giles’s, the town and country, clamoured in admiration
of the ‘beautiful red prints.’ They became a favourite
decoration everywhere from the palace to the lodging-house,
and a sentimental swarm of sickly designs from
incidents in favourite novels succeeded to the gentle,
nerveless groups of Angelica.”—<i>European Magazine.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c138"><i>TENIERS (DAVID), FATHER AND SON.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>AVID TENIERS was born at Antwerp in 1582.
He studied under Rubens, and afterwards at Rome.
On his return home he employed himself in painting small
pictures of carousals, fairs, and rural scenes, which he executed
in an admirable manner. He died in 1649. He
had two sons, Abraham and David, who were both artists;
the former excelled in the chiaroscuro, and expression of
character. The younger, David, born at Antwerp in
1610, was called “the Ape of Painting,” from his facility
in imitating any style. He was esteemed by several sovereigns,
and the King of Spain erected a gallery on purpose
for his pictures. His chief talent lay in landscape and conversations.
He died in 1694.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c139"><i>DAVID TENIERS THE YOUNGER, AT THE<br>
VILLAGE ALE HOUSE.</i></p>

<p>From Payne’s “Royal Dresden Gallery” we extract the
following:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Let us follow our artist in one of his wanderings.
He strolls from the time-honoured walls of Antwerp,
towards a village situated on the Scheldt, and enters the
ale-house, which has already furnished him with so many
original sketches, and is not likely to fail on the present
occasion. Four guests, attended by the toothless old
servant of the house, are seated at a table of rough oak;
but their discourse is of such a deeply interesting character
that they take no notice whatever of either host, hostess,
or guests.</p>

<p>“On the right of the table sits an old Scheldt fisherman
with a dilapidated high crowned hat on his head, a decided
countenance, which is shaded by an ample beard; his well
used pipe of brown clay together with its accompanying
bag of tobacco are stuck in his girdle like weapons of war.
This man is called by the others Jan van Bierlich. On the
other side of the table sits the son of the old boatman, a
powerful looking fellow about thirty years old, with an open
cast of countenance. He wears the old Flemish jacket
without arms, and an old-fashioned head dress: this man’s
name is Willen.</p>

<p>“In vain has the son importuned the father to permit him
to marry the prettiest, but poorest, maiden of the village.
The father of the bride, Mynheer Taaks, has taken his place
opposite to the boatman; he is a mild looking man, with
long brown hair. The fourth guest is Izak, a bearded son
of Israel, and the negociator of the present affair.</p>

<p>“He has promised the bride Katerina to advance the
necessary dowry, on condition the bridegroom will take the
debt on himself. All three have consequently combined to
persuade the boatman to take their view of the case. ‘I
will give my Katerina two thousand golden florins!’ cries
Taaks. ‘But I have not said Ja,’ replies the boatman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
‘Have you anything to say against the maiden?’ ‘Nothing
at all,’ replies the boatman; ‘I like her very well if
she has got money. But I object to you, Mynheer Taaks,
because you are not able to drink a proper quantity of beer:
do you think I am going to have a relation that will annoy
me all the days of my life instead of being a comfort to
me?’ Izak winked at Taaks. ‘As for that,’ said Taaks,
‘I believe I can drink more than you, Mynheer!’</p>

<p>“‘I should like to see you do that,’ said the boatman,
drily. ‘But I will only drink on a proper understanding,—Is
my daughter to marry your son, if I prove to be a good
toper?’ ‘How can I tell what you call a good toper?’
cried Jan, ‘but I am willing to have one bout with you;
and if you can drink a single glass more than I, I shall say
you are a good fellow, and you may bring your daughter to
my house to-morrow.’ He, however, whispered to Izak—‘Taaks
will soon be under the table, and that alone will
be well worth a hundred florins.’ The landlord brought
beer and chalk; the topers emptied the glasses in good
earnest, and scored each glass on the table beside them.
At length the old boatman beckoned to Taaks, who was
laughing heartily, but had for some time left off drinking,
and was regarding him with an air that showed he was
confident of victory. ‘The battle is over!’ cried Jan, ‘I
can drink no more; we will not count the glasses.’ ‘Oh!
Mynheer,’ cried Taaks, ‘I have got the most scores!’
Jan sprang on his feet, bent over the table, and compared
his score carefully with that of his opponent. ‘What
witchcraft is this?’ roared the boatman, clenching his fists,
‘you have not scored too much, because I have watched
you the whole time, and I have as surely not scored too
little, and yet you have drunk two more glasses than
I? I who was never beaten at beer-drinking before!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Willen, his son, reckoned the score after him, while the old
servant, who saw the joke, glanced slily over his shoulder
at the scene, while old Izak observed the comical fury of
the old boatman with a very knowing look. The fact was,
that Izak had secretly contrived to rub out part of old Jan’s
score as soon as he had marked it down.</p>

<p>“Jan called the host as a witness; the host took the
chalk, went to the doorpost, and began to reckon; but the
rogue had been drawn into the plot, and he completed the
joke, by making his reckoning agree with that of the others.
Jan van Bierlich was compelled, as a man of his word, to
strike his colours. Five minutes afterwards, Willen and the
pretty Katerina were betrothed, and a few moments later
David Teniers, the younger, returned to Antwerp, carrying
in his pocket the sketch of this charming picture.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c140"><i>WEST (BENJAMIN), P.R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>ENJAMIN WEST was born in America, in the year
1738. It is said that his grandfather was one of
those who accompanied the celebrated Penn to the young
country. Like most of those who make their way in the art
of painting, he very early displayed a strong inclination for
drawing. After considerable difficulty in pecuniary matters,
he was enabled, chiefly through his own industry, to visit
Italy. He suffered several severe attacks of illness while in
Italy, notwithstanding which his progress in the art was very
rapid. He visited London in 1763. His pictures exhibited
in Spring Gardens meeting with much favour, he
resolved to fix his residence here in the country of his
ancestors. The amount of professional work—chiefly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
historical—produced by this great artist is beyond all precedent.
Of his many compositions the best are generally
admitted to be those taken from Sacred History. And
generally as an historical painter, it would be difficult to
name his superior in the amount of his productions and
artistic merit. He died in 1820, at the age of 82.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c141"><i>LEIGH HUNT.</i></p>

<p>Among the large circle of the friends of Mr. West was the
late Leigh Hunt, who thus expresses his warm attachment
on the sale of the celebrated artist’s pictures:—</p>

<p>“It is a villainous thing to those who have known a man
for years, and been intimate with the quiet inside of his
house, privileged from intrusion, to see a sale of his goods
going on upon the premises. It is often not to be helped,
and what he himself wishes and enjoins; but still it is a
villainous necessity,—a hard cut to some of one’s oldest and
tenderest recollections. There is a sale of this kind now
going on in the house we spoke of last week. We spoke of
it then under an impulse not easy to be restrained, and not
difficult to be allowed us; and we speak of it now under
another. We were returning the day before yesterday from
a house where we had been entertained with lively accounts
of foreign countries and the present features of the time,
when we saw the door in Newman Street standing wide
open, and disclosing to every passenger a part of the gallery
at the end of the hall. All our boyhood came over us, with
the recollection of those who had accompanied us into
that house. We hesitated whether we should go in, and
see an auction taking place of the old quiet abstraction;
but we do not easily suffer an unpleasant and vulgar association
to overcome a greater one; and besides, how could we
pass? Having passed the threshold, without the ceremony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
of the smiling old porter, we found a worthy person sitting at
the door of the gallery, who, on hearing our name, seemed
to have old times come upon him as much as ourselves,
and was very warm in his services. We entered the gallery,
which we had entered hundreds of times in childhood, by
the side of a mother, who used to speak of the great persons
and transactions in the pictures on each side of her with a
hushing reverence, as if they were really present. But the
pictures were not there—neither Cupid with his doves, nor
Agrippina with the ashes of Germanicus, nor the Angel
slaying the army of Sennacherib, nor Death on the Pale
Horse, nor Jesus healing the Sick, nor the Deluge, nor
Moses on the Mount, nor King Richard pardoning his
brother John, nor the installation of the old Knights of the
Garter, nor Greek and Italian stories, nor the landscapes of
Windsor Forest, nor Sir Philip Sidney, mortally wounded,
giving up the water to the dying Soldier. They used to
cover the wall; but now there were only a few engravings.
The busts and statues also were gone. But there was the
graceful little piece of garden as usual, with its grass-plat
and its clumps of lilac. They could not move the grass
plat, even to sell it. Turning to the left, there was the
privileged study which we used to enter between the
Venus de Medicis and the Apollo of the Vatican. They
were gone, like their mythology. Beauty and intellect were
no longer waiting on each side of the door. Turning again,
we found the longer part of the gallery like the other; and
in the vista through another room, the auction was going
on. We saw a throng of faces of business with their hats
on, and heard the hard-hearted knocks of the hammer,
in a room which used to hold the mild and solitary artist
at his work, and which had never been entered but with
quiet steps and a face of consideration. We did not stop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
a minute. In the room between this and the gallery,
huddled up in a corner, were the busts and statues which
had given us a hundred thoughts. Since the days when we
first saw them, we have seen numbers like them, and many
of more valuable materials; for though good of their kind,
and of old standing, they are but common plaster. But
the thoughts and the recollections belonged to no others,
and it appeared sacrilege to see them in that state.</p>

<p>“Into the parlour, which opens out of the hall and into the
garden, we did not look. We scarcely know why; but we
did not. In that parlour, we used to hear of our maternal
ancestors, stout yet kind-hearted Englishmen, who set up
their tents with Penn in the wilderness. And there we
learnt to unite the love of freedom with that of the graces of
life; for our host, though born a Quaker, and appointed a
royal painter, and not so warm in his feelings as those about
him, had all the natural amenity belonging to those graces,
and never truly lost sight of that love of freedom. There we
grew up acquainted with the divine humanities of Raphael.
There we remember a large coloured print of the old Lion-Hunt
of Rubens, in which the boldness of the action and
the glow of colouring overcome the horror of the struggle.
And there, long before we knew anything of Ariosto, we
were as familiar as young playmates with the beautiful
Angelica and Medoro, who helped to fill our life with love.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c142"><i>JOHN CONSTABLE.</i></p>

<p>Constable used to relate:—“Under some disappointment,
I think it was the rejection at the Academy of a view of
Flatford Mill, I carried a picture to Mr. West, who said:
‘Don’t be disheartened, young man, we shall hear of you
again; you must have loved nature very much before
you could have painted this.’ He then took a piece of
chalk and showed me how I might improve the chiaroscuro
by some additional touches of light between the stems and
branches of the trees, saying; ‘Always remember, sir, that
light and shadow <i>never stand still</i>,”—and added: ‘Whatever
object you are painting, keep in mind its accidental appearance
(unless in the subject there is some peculiar
reason for the latter), and never be content until you have
transferred that to canvas. In your skies, for instance,
always aim at <i>brightness</i>, although there are states of the
atmosphere in which the sky itself is not bright. I do not
mean that you are not to paint solemn or lowering skies,
but even in the darkest effects there should be brightness.
Your darks should look like the darks of silver, not of lead
or of slate.’”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c143"><i>WILLIAM WOOLLET.</i></p>

<p>The following amusing anecdote is told of the engraver’s
unexpected alterations in a plate. On bringing to Mr.
West what he conceived to be a finished impression of one
of his prints from an historical picture by the great painter,
he inquired, with his usual mild deference, “If Mr. West
thought that there was anything more to be done to the
plate?” The painter, with a tone of affability and a smile
of pleasure, while he surveyed the print, exclaimed: “More!
Anything more, Mr. Woollet! No, sir, nothing,—nothing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
It is excellent! admirable! only just suppose we take down
these shadows, in the middle distance; a nothing,—a mere
nothing!”—at the same time touching upon that part of
the print with grey chalk, to lower it to the requisite tint;—“Nothing,
Mr. Woollet! nothing at all! It is fine, very
fine!—but perhaps we may throw a little more force into
these near figures,”—heightening the shadows with black
chalk,—“then, I think, all will be done!—Yes, all! nothing
will remain; <i>only</i>, if we can contrive to keep those parts
together:”—adding a faint wash of India ink. “There—there,
now take it: Mr. Woollet take it; it would be overdoing
it to hazard a single touch more! But stop!—stay!
this reflection in the water;—a few touches, just to keep it
quiet;—and the edges of these clouds a little more,—that
is, I mean, a little less edgy,—more kept down. Good,
very good!—There, now, Mr. Woollet, you shall not persuade
me to give it another touch; you can make these few
little alterations, any time at your leisure.” Woollet, who
justly looked up to West as the father of the British School
of Historical Painting, heard and saw all with thankful good
humour, while West spoke and worked, and worked and
spoke upon the proof; although the engraver was conscious
that the suggested alterations would occupy a long time,
and they actually delayed the publication some months,
though with great advantage to the effect of the engraving.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c144"><i>JAMES NORTHCOTE, R.A.</i></p>

<p>“I remember once being at the Academy, when Sir
Joshua wished to propose a monument to Dr. Johnson in
St. Paul’s, and West got up and said that the King, he knew,
was averse to anything of the kind, for he had been proposing
a similar monument in Westminster Abbey for a
man of the greatest genius and celebrity,—one whose works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
were in all the cabinets of the curious throughout Europe,—one
whose name they would all hear with the greatest
respect; and then it came out, after a long preamble, that
he meant Woollet, who had engraved his ‘Death of Wolfe.’
I was provoked, and could not help exclaiming: ‘My
God! What! do you put him upon a footing with such a
man as Dr. Johnson,—one of the greatest philosophers and
moralists that ever lived? We have thousands of engravers
at any time!’ And there was such a burst of laughter at this,—Dance,
who was a grave gentleman, laughed till the tears
ran down his cheeks; and Farrington, the painter, used
afterwards to say to me, ‘Why don’t you speak in the Academy,
and begin with “My God!” as you do sometimes?’”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c145"><i>YOUTHFUL AMBITION.</i></p>

<p>West entertained very grand notions of Art and of its
professors. He was about to ride with a school-fellow to a
neighbouring plantation. “Here is the horse,” said the
boy, “bridled and saddled, so come, get up behind me.”
“Behind you!” said West; “I will ride behind nobody!”
“Oh, very well,” said the other, “I will ride behind you;
so mount.” He mounted, and away they rode. “This is the
last ride I shall have for some time,” said the boy; “for
I am, to-morrow, to be apprenticed to a tailor.” “A tailor!”
exclaimed West; “you will surely never be a tailor!”
“Indeed, but I shall,” returned the other; “it is a good
trade. What do you intend to be, Ben?” “A painter!”
“A painter!—Why, what sort of a trade is painter? I have
never heard o’ it before.” “A painter,” said West, grandly,
“is the companion of kings and emperors.” “You are
surely mad,” said the other; “Why, they don’t have kings
nor emperors in ’Merriky!” “Ah! but there are plenty in
other parts of the world. But do you really mean to be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
tailor?” “Indeed I do; there’s nothing more certain.”
“Then you may ride alone,” said West, leaping down; “I
will not ride with one who would be a tailor.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c146"><i>PERSEVERANCE IN ART.</i></p>

<p>Being subject to the gout, it attacked his right hand while
he was painting his great picture of “Death on the Pale
Horse;” but this did not check his ardour, for he proceeded
with his left hand, and the whole was finished by himself
without any assistance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c147"><i>WILKIE (SIR DAVID), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>AVID WILKIE, the son of a Scotch minister, was
born in 1785. His genius for the art in which he
was destined to become so famous, was displayed even in
his infancy, and led to his being sent to study in the Edinburgh
Academy, where he had for his fellow-students Sir
William Allen and John Burnet. At the age of nineteen
his performances had attracted so much notice that he was
confirmed in his professional career. He started for London,
studied at the Academy, became an exhibitor, and so paved
the way for his bright success of after-years. Among his
intimate companions was Haydon,—another equally celebrated
painter, though not equally successful, who relates
the following:—</p>

<p>“When the Academy opened, Wilkie, who had gained
admission as a probationer by means of a drawing from
the Niobe, took his seat with his class. Something of his
Edinburgh fame had preceded him: Jackson, at that time
a student, seems to have seen as well as heard of him, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
he wrote to me, then young and ardent, to hasten from
Devonshire, for that a tall, pale, thin Scotsman had just
come to study at the Academy, who had done something
from Macbeth, of which report spoke highly. Touched
with this, I came at once to London and went to the
Academy. Wilkie, the most punctual of mankind, was there
before me. We sat and drew in silence for some time; at
length Wilkie rose, came and looked over my shoulder,
said nothing, and resumed his seat. I rose, went and
looked over his shoulder, said nothing, and resumed my
seat. We saw enough to satisfy us of each other’s skill,
and when the class broke up we went and dined together.”</p>

<p>The acquaintance thus begun ripened into a warm friendship,
notwithstanding occasional disputes arising from a
dissimilarity in taste of the two artists.</p>

<p>Haydon also relates the following:—</p>

<p>“Wilkie, who was always hospitable in his nature, invited
me one morning to breakfast, soon after his arrival in
London, I went accordingly to 8, Norton Street, and
knocked at the door of his apartments; a voice said, ‘Come
in.’ I opened the door and found, instead of the breakfast
which I expected, the painter sitting partly naked and
drawing from his left knee for a figure which he had on his
easel. He was not at all moved, for nought moved Wilkie;
and when I expressed some surprise at what he was about,
he replied with a smile, ‘It’s capital practice, let me tell
you.’”</p>

<p>About this time (1805), in a letter written by Wilkie to a
fellow-student, occurs the following characteristic passage:
“And I am convinced now that no picture can possess real
merit unless it is a just representation of nature.”</p>

<p>On the sale of his first commission picture, “The Village
Politicians,” he thus buoyantly concludes a letter to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
father, “My ambition is got beyond all bounds, and I have
the vanity to hope that Scotland will one day be proud to
boast of your affectionate son,</p>

<p class="r">
“<span class="smcap">David Wilkie</span>.”
</p>

<p>On the death of his father, he invited his mother and
sister over from Scotland to live with him in London. In
after-years, writing to a friend, he adds, “If I were desired
to name the happiest hour of my life, I should say it was
when I first saw my honoured mother and much loved
sister sitting beside me while I was painting.”</p>

<p>Another scene, of a different description, at Wilkie’s
house is worthy of insertion. Mr. Collins’s brother, Francis,
possessed a remarkably retentive memory, which he
was accustomed to use for the amusement of himself and
others, in the following way. He learnt by heart a whole
number of one of Dr. Johnson’s “Ramblers,” and used to
cause considerable diversion to those in the secret, by
repeating it all through to a new company in a conversational
tone, as if it were the accidental product of his
own fancy,—now addressing his flow of moral eloquence
to one astonished auditor, and now to another. One day,
when the two brothers were dining at Wilkie’s, it was
determined to try the experiment upon their host. After
dinner, accordingly, Mr. Collins paved the way for the
coming speech, by leading the conversation imperceptibly
to the subject of the paper in the “Rambler.” At the right
moment Francis Collins began. As the first grand Johnsonian
sentences struck upon his ear (uttered, it should be
remembered, in the most elaborately careless and conversational
manner,) Wilkie started at the high tone that the
conversation had suddenly assumed, and looked vainly to
his friend Collins for explanation, who, on <i>his</i> part sat with
his eyes respectfully fixed on his brother, all rapt attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
to the eloquence that was dropping from his lips. Once or
twice, with perfect mimicry of the conversational character
he had assumed, Francis Collins hesitated, stammered, and
paused, as if collecting his thronging ideas. At one or two
of these intervals, Wilkie endeavoured to speak, to ask a
moment for consideration; but the torrent of his guest’s
eloquence was not to be delayed,—“it was too rapid to stay
for any man,—away it went” like Mr. Shandy’s oratory
before “My Uncle Toby,”—until at last it reached its
destined close; and then Wilkie, who, as host, thought it
his duty to break silence by the first compliment, exclaimed
with the most perfect unconsciousness of the trick that
had been played him, “Ay, ay, Mr. Francis; verra clever
(though I did not understand it <i>all</i>),—verra clever!”</p>

<p>His friends relate of him (Wilkie) that he could draw
before he could write. He recollected this himself, and
spoke to me of an old woman who had in her cottage near
his father’s manse a clean scoured wooden stool, on which
she used to allow him to draw with a coarse carpenter’s
pencil, and then scrub it out to be ready for another day.</p>

<p>Collins relates the following of Wilkie with whom he
lived on terms of the closest intimacy.</p>

<p>“When Lord Mulgrave’s pictures were sold at Christie’s,
Wilkie waited in the neighbourhood whilst I attended the
sale. It was quite refreshing to see his joy when I returned
with a list of the prices. The sketches produced more
than five hundred per cent., the pictures three hundred. I
recollect one,—a small, early picture, called ‘Sunday Morning’—I
asked Wilkie what he thought of its fetching, as it
did, a hundred and ten pounds, and whether Lord Mulgrave
had not got it cheap enough?—‘Why, he gave me fifteen
pounds for it!’ When I expressed my surprise that he
should have given so small a sum for so clever a work,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
Wilkie, defending him, said:—‘Ah, but consider, as I was
not known at that time, <i>it was a great risk</i>!’”</p>

<p>Dr. Chalmers was asked by Wilkie whether Principal
Baird would preach before the King. (Now, Principal Baird
had a sad way of crying in the pulpit.) “Why,” replied
Chalmers, “if he does, it will be George Baird to George
Rex, <i>greeting</i>!”</p>

<p>Wilkie died in the year 1841, aged 56 years.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c148">“<i>LETTER OF INTRODUCTION.</i>”</p>

<p>This picture was suggested by the reception which the
artist himself experienced, it is said by Cunningham in his
Life of Wilkie, from one of the small wits about town,
Caleb Whiteford by name, discoverer of the “cross-readings”
in newspapers, and who set up for a judge in art.
Some one desirous to do a good turn to Wilkie, when he
first came to town, gave him a note to Caleb, who, struck
with his very youthful look, inquired how old he was.
“Really now,” said the artist, with the hesitation he bestowed
on most questions. “Ha!” exclaimed Caleb;
“introduce a man to me who knows not how old he is!”
and regarded him with that dubious look which is the chief
charm of the picture. This was in his mind when he
formed the resolution to paint the subject.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c149"><i>COLLINS’S REMINISCENCES OF WILKIE.</i></p>

<p>“Wilkie was not quick in perceiving a joke, although he
was always anxious to do so, and to recollect humorous
stories, of which he was exceedingly fond. As instances, I
recollect once when we were staying at Mr. Wells’s, at
Redleaf, one morning at breakfast a very small puppy was
running about under the table. ‘Dear me,’ said a lady,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
‘how this creature teases me!’ I took it up and put it
into my breast-pocket. Mr. Wells said, ‘That is a pretty
nosegay.’—‘Yes,’ said I, ‘it is a <i>dog-rose</i>.’ Wilkie’s attention,
sitting opposite, was called to his friend’s pun: but all
in vain,—he could not be persuaded to see anything in it.
I recollect trying once to explain to him, with the same
want of success, Hogarth’s joke in putting the sign of the
woman without a head, (‘The Good Woman’) under the
window from whence the quarrelsome wife is throwing the
dinner into the street.</p>

<p>“Chantrey and Wilkie were dining alone with me, when
the former, in his great kindness for Wilkie, ventured, as he
said, to take him to task for his constant use of the word
‘<i>relly</i>’ (really) when listening to any conversation in which
he was interested. ‘Now, for instance,’ said Chantrey,
‘suppose I was giving you an account of any interesting
matter, you would constantly say, ‘<i>Relly!</i>’ ‘<i>Relly!</i>’ exclaimed
Wilkie immediately, with a look of the most perfect
astonishment.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c150"><i>WILKIE’S ARREST AT CALAIS.</i></p>

<p>When returning from a short Continental tour in 1816,
Wilkie became involved in a difficulty at Calais similar to
that of Hogarth at the same place, as indicated by our
great moral painter in his print of “Oh, the Roast Beef
of Old England.” Wilkie, while busily engaged in making
a sketch of the gate, was accosted by an officer of police,
and taken before the mayor, who told the artist he could
not be permitted to make drawings of any of the fortifitions,
and courteously dismissed him. The observation
was made in England that Wilkie sought his arrest on
this occasion, wishing to re-enact the Hogarth incident:
but his well-known unobtrusive manners and unaffected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
modesty completely vindicate him from such an accusation.</p>

<p>The following <i>naïve</i> account of the arrest of Sir David
Wilkie is told by him in a letter to his friend and travelling
companion, Abraham Raimbach, the celebrated engraver of
many of the artist’s pictures:—</p>

<p>“On travelling through France the most singular occurrence
was that of my being arrested at Calais, in the act of
completing a sketch of the celebrated gate of Hogarth. A
young Englishman, who had come from Lille with me, had
agreed to remain with me while I was making the drawing;
and as I had first obtained leave from the officer of the
guard, I expected no sort of interruption. After I had
been at work, however, about an hour, with a great crowd
about me, a <i>gendarme</i> came to me, and with an imperious
tone, said, ‘<i>Par quelle autorité faites-vous cela, monsieur?</i>’
I pointed to the officer on guard, and told him that he
had given me leave. ‘<i>Ce n’est rien—c’est défendu, monsieur.
Il faut que vous preniez votre livre et m’accompagniez à l’Hôtel
de Ville.</i>’ This, of course, I agreed to most willingly, and
beckoning my friend to go too, I went along with him, with
all the people staring at us. At the Hôtel de Ville we were
requested to go to the mayor, and as we were marching
along to his house, the <i>gendarme</i> said, ‘<i>Voila le maire,—arrêtons.</i>’
We stopped till the mayor came up, and learning
from us what was the matter, he dismissed the <i>gendarme</i>,
took us back to his house, and told me, that as there were
a number of people there, as in other places, who, on
seeing a foreigner making a drawing of a fortified place,
would naturally suppose it to be from a hostile intention,
and finding it done <i>en plein jour</i>, would be apt to blame
the magistrates for allowing it; he said it was necessary,
therefore, that I should not go on with my drawing,
although, from examining it, he was satisfied that I only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
did it for amusement, and therefore regretted the interruption.”—<i>Memoirs

<p class="c sp" id="c151"><i>HIS OPINION OF MICHAEL ANGELO AND RAPHAEL.</i></p>

<p>“The labours of Michael Angelo and Raphael have
since been the chief object of my study,—by far the most
intellectual. They make other works appear limited, and
though high in all that is great, are still an example,—and
a noble example too,—of how the accessories of a
work may be treated with most advantage. No style can
be so pure as to be above learning from them, nor so
low and humble as not to gain even in its own way by
their contemplation. They have that without which the
Venus and the Apollo would lose their value, and with
which the mean forms of Ostade and Rembrandt become
instructive and sublime,—namely, expression and sentiment.
To some of the younger artists here, however, I find they
are a stumbling-block; things to be admired but not imitated,
and less to be copied than any flat, empty piece of
Venetian colouring that comes in their way. The effect
of these works upon the unlearned public at large deserves
attention. Frescoes, when old, get dull and dry, and cannot
be repaired or refreshed like oil; their impression,
therefore, upon the common eye is not striking, and many
people acknowledge this who, show them a new print from
Raphael or Michael Angelo, would be delighted. Vividness
is perhaps necessary to make any work generally
impressive; and suppose these fresh as they were at first,
and as I have seen some recent frescoes, I believe they
would be the most beautiful things imaginable,—popular
beyond a doubt, as it is on record they were so.”—<i>Memoirs
of Abraham Raimbach.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c152"><i>WILSON (RICHARD), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">R</span>ICHARD WILSON was born in Montgomeryshire
in the year 1713. He excelled as a landscape
painter. After practising some time in London, he was
enabled, by the assistance of relations, to travel into Italy,
where he renewed the study of portrait painting, in which
he had made some progress when in London. But the
peculiar form and bias of his genius was landscape, as was
shown so powerfully later in life by his famous productions,
among others, of “Niobe” and the “Villa of Mæcenas.”
An incident which happened during his visit to Italy tended
to confirm him in his inclination to follow landscape instead
of portrait painting. The celebrated French painter, Vernet,
happening one day when in Rome to visit Wilson’s painting-room,
was so struck with a landscape Wilson had painted
that he requested to become the possessor of it, offering
in exchange one of his best pictures. The proposal was
readily accepted, and Vernet kindly recommended Wilson
to the English nobility and gentry then visiting Rome. It
is said of Wilson that at times, through his intemperate and
irregular habits, he was obliged to pawn his pictures, and
was sometimes unable to procure canvas or colours. Fuseli,
though generally severe in his criticism of the “map makers,”
as he designated the landscape painters of his day, formed
what I consider an exaggerated estimate of Wilson’s merits.
He says of him: “He is now numbered with the classics of
the Art, though little more than the fifth of a century has
elapsed since death relieved him from the apathy of cognoscenti,
the envy of rivals, and the neglect of a tasteless
public; for Wilson, whose works will soon command prices
as proud as those of Claude, Poussin, or Elzheimer, resembled
the last most in his fate,—lived and died nearer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
to indigence than ease; and as an asylum for the severest
wants incident to age and decay of powers, was reduced
to solicit the librarian’s place in the Academy of which
he was one of the brightest ornaments.” Wilson died on
the 11th of May, 1782, aged 69.</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c153"><i>A SCENE AT CHRISTIE’S.</i></p>

<p>“Towards the close of Wilson’s life, annoyed and oppressed
by the neglect which he experienced, it is well
known that he unfortunately had recourse to those means
of temporary oblivion of the world to which disappointed
genius but too frequently resorts. The natural consequence
was, that the works which he then produced were much
inferior to those of his former days,—a fact of which, of
course, he was not himself conscious. One morning, Mr.
Christie, to whom had been entrusted the sale by auction
of a fine collection of pictures belonging to a nobleman,
having arrived at a <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of Wilson’s, was expatiating
with his usual eloquence on its merits, quite unaware that
Wilson himself had just before entered the room. ‘This,
gentlemen, is one of Mr. Wilson’s Italian pictures; he
cannot paint anything like it now.’ ‘That’s a lie!’ exclaimed
the irritated artist, to Mr. Christie’s no small discomposure,
and to the great amusement of the company;
‘he can paint infinitely better.’”—<i>Literary Gazette</i>, 1824.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="c154"><i>ZOFFANY (JOHANN), R.A.</i></h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>OHANN ZOFFANY was born at Frankfort-on-the-Maine
in the year 1735. He was by descent a
Bohemian, but his father, who followed the profession
of an architect, had settled in Germany. When a mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
child, having shown considerable ability with the pencil,
his father sent him to Italy, where he studied several years.
He practised, on his return to Germany, as an historical
and portrait painter at Coblentz on the Rhine. He arrived
in England but a few years before the foundation of the
Royal Academy, and was elected one of its first members
in 1768. On his arrival, the extent of his finances hardly
amounted to the sum of one hundred pounds. “With this,”
he relates, “I commenced maccaroni, bought a suit <i>à la
mode</i>, a gold watch, and gold-headed cane.” Thus equipped
he made the acquaintance of Benjamin Wilson, a portrait
painter, then residing in Great Queen Street, Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields.
With this artist Zoffany engaged himself as drapery-painter,
and remained with him until, tired of the monotony
of his employment, he determined to try his fortune by
trading on the capital of his talent on his own account.
He accordingly took furnished apartments at the upper part
of Tottenham Court Road, and began his practice as a
<i>Limner</i>, by painting the portraits of his landlord and landlady,
which, as a standing advertisement, were placed on
either side the gate that then opened into the area before
the house. Garrick, by chance, passing that way, saw these
specimens, admired them, and inquired for the painter.
The interview ended in his employing Zoffany to paint
himself in small, and hence were produced those admired
subjects in which the great actor figured,—“Sir John Brute;”
<i>Abel Drugger</i>, in Ben Jonson’s “Alchemist;” “The Farmer’s
Return,” etc. Sir Joshua Reynolds was so pleased with the
painting in which Garrick is represented as <i>Abel Drugger</i>,
that he purchased it of Zoffany for the sum of one hundred
guineas. It is related that the Earl of Carlisle, conversing
with Sir Joshua upon the merits of the picture, earnestly
urged him to part with it. “Well, my lord,” said he, “what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
premium will you pay upon my purchase?” “Any sum you
will name,” replied the earl. “Then it is yours, my lord,
if you will pay me one hundred guineas, and add fifty as a
gratuity to Mr. Zoffany.” He consented, and purchased the
picture. In 1771, Zoffany painted the royal family on a
large canvas, to the number of ten portraits, which has been
engraved in mezzotinto by Earlom. He painted likewise
two separate portraits of George III. and his Queen, which
were also engraved in mezzotinto by Houston. Shortly after
this, he paid a second visit to Italy, and taking a recommendation
from George III. to the Grand Duke of Tuscany
at Florence, he painted an interior view of the Florentine
picture gallery. The hopes which he had indulged as to the
result of this exertion of his talent were frustrated; for when
the Queen was informed that the painter expected to be paid
two thousand guineas for his picture, she showed no inclination
to receive it. Some years after, the Queen purchased
it off him at the greatly reduced sum of six hundred guineas.
In 1774, he painted his much-admired picture of the “Life
School of the Royal Academy,” in which he introduced two
naked models and thirty-six portraits. This painting was
also engraved in mezzotinto by Earlom. In 1781, Zoffany
went to the East Indies, where he painted three of his best
works. One is the “Embassy of Hyderbeck to Calcutta,”
who was sent by the Vizier of Oude to Lord Cornwallis.
He went with a numerous retinue by Patna to Calcutta.
This picture is a rich display of Indian costume, and contains
besides about one hundred figures, several elephants
and horses. The scene is placed in Patna. The other two
pictures are an “Indian Tiger Hunt;” and as a companion
to the Embassy, a “Cock Fight,” at which there are many
spectators. Zoffany returned to London with a large fortune,
and died at Kew, December 16th, 1810.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>


<p class="c sp" id="c155"><i>THE ROYAL PICTURE.</i></p>

<p>When Zoffany began the picture of the royal family there
were ten children. He made his sketch accordingly, and
attending two or three times, went on finishing the figures.
Various circumstances prevented him from proceeding,—his
Majesty was engaged in business of more consequence;
her Majesty was engaged; some of the princesses were
engaged, and some of the princesses were unwell. The
completion of the picture was consequently delayed, when
a messenger came to inform the artist that another prince
was born, and must be introduced in the picture; this was
not easy, but it was accomplished with some difficulty.
All this took up much time, when a second messenger
arrived to announce the birth of a princess, and to acquaint
him that the illustrious stranger must have a place in the
canvas; this was impossible without a new arrangement:
one half of the figures were therefore obliterated, in order
that the grouping might be closer to make room. To do this
was the business of some months, and before it was finished,
a letter came from one of the maids of honour, informing
the painter that there was another addition to the family, for
whom a place must be found. “This,” cried the artist, “is
too much; if they cannot sit with more regularity, I cannot
paint with more expedition, and must give it up.”</p>


<p class="c sp" id="c156"><i>THE “COCK FIGHT.”</i></p>

<p>The ship in which this picture left the Indies was wrecked,
and the picture lost. Zoffany fortunately took his passage
in another vessel. It is said he heard of the loss of his
picture with the philosophy of a Stoic. Having his original
sketches by him, he set to work again and made out a second
picture with all the grouping, portraits of Hindoos and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
Gentoos, Rajahs and Nabobs, and finished a fac-simile of
the first. It is said Governor Hastings, by whose commission
it was originally painted, was never made acquainted
with the accident and its repainting.</p>

<p class="c sp"><i>THE ROYAL ACADEMY, BURLINGTON HOUSE.</i></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE new rooms of the Royal Academy were erected
from the designs, and under the superintendence, of
Mr. Sydney Smirke, R.A., and consist of a large oblong
block, parallel with Burlington House, and separated from
it only by a few feet, but extending on both sides considerably
beyond its frontage. The exhibition-rooms are approached
by a noble staircase, with paintings by Ricci,
which formed part of Burlington House. The galleries are
divided into three lines or rows; five each in the north and
south rows, and four in the middle. The central room is a
domed octagonal sculpture saloon. Occupying the whole
space westward of this is the “Great Room,” where the
annual dinner takes place. Eastward of the central saloon
is a lecture-hall; the remaining space eastward affords a
room for water-colour drawings, and the gallery south of
that for architectural drawings. All the exhibition-rooms
communicate with each other. The dimensions of the
apartments are as follows:—</p>

<p>The height of the walls in the Great Room to the top of the
cornice is 27 ft., the cove occupies 11 ft., making the height
to the underside of lantern 38 ft. In the lesser rooms, the
height to the top of the cornice is 22 ft., and the cove
occupies 9 ft. The lighting is by means of a large central skylight
in each gallery, excepting the Sculpture Room, where
there is a side light. The walls of the Picture Galleries are
of a deep subdued red, down to a dado of black wood
and walnut. The choice rested between this and “pheasant
egg colour.” The fine art critic of the <i>Times</i>, in his article
of the 1st of May, 1869, makes the following appropriate
remarks on this grand and useful suite of rooms, in which
it is to be hoped that the Hanging Committee will for the
future be able to display the pictures to the satisfaction of
the artists and the public:—“The fears, if they were genuine
fears, expressed by some of the Academicians as to the
result of removal from Trafalgar Square to Piccadilly can
hardly have survived the private view of the Exhibition
yesterday. The verdict of the select crowd which filled the
stately apartments provided by the architects of the new
Academy building for its annual Exhibition was unanimous.
No European capital can now boast a more commodious and
noble suite of rooms for its yearly display of painting and
sculpture than London now possesses.”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c158"><i>THE FONTHILL COLLECTION.</i></p>

<p>William Beckford, Esq., one of the most remarkable men
of modern times, was the son of the patriotic Alderman
Beckford, who was Lord Mayor in the years 1762 and
1769, and whose noble and courageous remonstrance with
George III. is engraved under the monument erected to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
memory in Guildhall. Inheriting property amounting to
£100,000 per annum, Mr. Beckford was enabled to indulge
in the expensive amusement of building. Fonthill Abbey
arose like a magic palace at his command, one tower alone
employing 460 men, both by day and night, through an
entire winter; the torches used by the nocturnal workmen
being visible to the astonished traveller at miles distant.
This celebrated mansion in a few years cost Mr. Beckford
the sum of £273,000. Owing to the rapidity of the work
the mortar had not time to consolidate, and a heavy gale of
wind brought the great tower to the ground. Merely remarking
that he should have been glad to witness the
sublime fall of such a mass of materials, he gave orders for
the erection of another tower, 276 feet in height; this also
fell to the earth in the year 1825. Mr. Beckford was an
excellent scholar, and possessed a fine taste in almost every
branch of art. He collected, in the fantastic but costly
Abbey, one of the finest and most extensive libraries in
England; and his galleries of pictures and antiquities were
almost unequalled. A Chancery suit,—that blessing to
lawyers,—fattened upon his riches for some years, and it
ended in the loss of a large West India property; this,
added to his other expenses, rendered it necessary to sell
the Abbey, with almost all its costly contents. In the year
1822, after Fonthill Abbey had been on view, and catalogues
issued by Messrs. Christie and Manson, the day
often fixed and as often postponed, it was at length announced
as being sold by private contract to Mr. Farquhar,
a gentleman who had amassed considerable property in
India, for the sum of £340,000, Mr. Beckford only
retaining his family pictures and a few books. After the
sale, Mr. Beckford resided for some years in Portugal.
Not merely a patron of art, he was also an author, and one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
singularly original in style. His wild and extraordinary tale,
entitled “Vathek,” soon formed a portion of our classical
literature. This extraordinary man died on the 25th of
May, 1844, at the advanced age of 84. In the year 1823,
we find the collection again in the market, its new proprietor
considering the furniture, etc., wholly unsuited to so
splendid a structure; the auctioneer on this occasion being
Mr. Phillips, of New Bond Street, who apprised the distinguished
company assembled on the first day, that the
sale was one of the most important that had ever been
offered to the British public. It occupied thirty-seven days,
and the amount realized was rather over £80,000.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c159"><i>THE STRAWBERRY HILL COLLECTION.</i></p>

<p>Lord Orford, more familiarly known as Horace Walpole,
the very finest gentleman of the last century, and the
founder of the Strawberry Hill Collection, was the youngest
son of the eminent minister, Sir Robert Walpole, and was
born October 5th, 1717. After studying at Eton and Cambridge,
he travelled; and it was while in Italy that he fostered
the love of Art, and taste for elegant and antiquarian literature,
which took such complete possession of him as to
engross the principal part of his long life. Walpole has by
some critics been designated an elegant trifler; yet if we
consider that he was one of the first to turn public attention
to a taste for the Arts, that he fostered the engravers in
this country who became eminent in their branch of Art, that
he brought from obscurity various historical memoirs of
deep interest, we shall hesitate to consider him a trifler.
Among English writers, Walpole is admitted to be one of
the best models for lively epistolary correspondence. In a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
letter to Sir Horace Mann, he writes: “You know my
passion for the writings of the younger Crébillon; you shall
hear how I have been mortified by the discovery of the
greatest meanness in him; and you will judge how one must
be humbled to have one’s favourite author convicted of
mere mortal mercenariness! I have desired Lady Mary to
lay out thirty guineas for me with Liotard, and wished if I
could to have the portraits of Crébillon and Marivaux for
my cabinet. Mr. Churchill wrote me word that Liotard’s
price was sixteen guineas; that Marivaux was intimate with
him and would certainly sit, and that he believed he could
get Crébillon to sit too. The latter, who is retired into the
provinces with an English wife, was just then at Paris for a
month; Mr. Churchill went to him, and told him that a
gentleman in England who was making a collection of
portraits of famous people, would be happy to have his,
etc. Crébillon was humble, ‘unworthy,’ obliged, and sat.
The picture was just finished, when, behold! he sent Mr.
Churchill word that he expected to have a copy of the
picture given him,—neither more nor less than asking sixteen
guineas for sitting! Mr. Churchill answered that he
could not tell what he should do, were it his own case; but
that it was a limited commission, and he could not possibly
lay out double; and was now so near his return that he
could not have time to write to England and have an
answer. Crébillon said, then he would keep the picture
himself—it was excessively like. I am still <i>sentimental</i>
enough to flatter myself, that a man who could beg sixteen
guineas, will not give them, and so I may still have the
picture.”</p>

<p>Walpole died on the 2nd of March, 1797. By command
of the Earl of Waldegrave, the contents of Strawberry Hill
were sold by auction on the 25th of April, 1842, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
proceeds of the sale, which lasted twenty-four days,
amounted to £33,450 11<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Tiffin, in his interesting little book, “Gossip about
Portraits,” writes mournfully of the dispersion of this <i>recherché</i>
collection: “What a melancholy time to the
amateur was that at Strawberry Hill, in 1842, when these
treasures were dispersed. In recalling that time when I
wandered through these rooms looking listlessly at many
objects that to the connoisseur (not only of art but of history)
‘spoke volumes.’ I began faintly to understand the worth
of such collections.”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c160"><i>THE SALTMARSHE COLLECTION.</i></p>

<p>On the 4th, 5th, and 6th of June, 1847, was sold by
auction, by Messrs. Christie and Manson, the collection of
pictures, the property of Mr. Higginson, of Saltmarshe,
Herefordshire. The total amount realized by the three
days’ sale, reached the enormous sum of £46,695 3<i>s.</i> At
the close of the sale it was remarked that the proceeds of
the last day, £35,789 9<i>s.</i> was the greatest sum realized in
one day on record. Though the collection was, on the
whole, more remarkable for numbers than quality, it contained
some good and important works. Mr. Higginson
was a gentleman possessed of considerable wealth, and was
in his day a rapacious accumulator of pictures. Five of
them alone brought upwards of £10,000. On the first
day’s sale, a fine example of Constable’s fetched 360 guineas;
a Nasmyth, 44 guineas; and “A Country Ale-house,” the
old hackneyed subject of George Morland, 95 guineas.
On the second day, a sum of 405 guineas was obtained for
a Gerhard Dow. On the third, and most important day of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the sale, the late Marquis of Hertford gave the grand sum
of 1000 guineas for a small female head by Greuze, one of
the most distinguished artists of the modern French school.
A truly important work of Claude’s fell to the same nobleman
for 1400 guineas. A landscape, the joint production
of P. De Koning and Lingelbach, was purchased by the
late Sir Robert Peel, and we believe has just been sold
to the Government by his son, the present Sir Robert.
“The Holy Family, with Elizabeth and Saint John,” by
Peter Paul Rubens, which was formerly in the Imperial
Gallery of Vienna, and afterwards in the possession of M.
Delahante, who gave 3000 guineas for it, upwards of thirty
years previous to the sale, was knocked down by the
auctioneer to the late Marquis of Hertford for the reduced
sum of 2360 guineas.</p>

<p>The contents of Stowe, the house of the Buckingham

Tuesday, the 15th of August, 1848. For full particulars of
the genealogy of this old and noble family, we must, with
pleasure, refer our readers to the annotated catalogue of the
choicest objects of art and vertu contained in its princely

bestowed considerable pains on the work he took in
hand; and in his “Historical Notice of Stowe,” after
enumerating the visits to it of almost all the crowned heads
of civilized Europe, gives some lines written by Mr.
Disraeli, M.P., while a guest at Stowe in the year 1840.
They are in allusion to a beautiful statuette by Cotterell, of
the Duke of Wellington, which His Grace of Buckingham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
had purchased, and up to the time of the sale had preserved

<p class="c sp" id="c162"><i>THE BERNAL COLLECTION.</i></p>

<p>In March and April, 1855, was dispersed by auction the
valuable collection made by Mr. Ralph Bernal of articles of
rare excellence, and of an age extremely rich in ornamental
art, extending from the Byzantine period to that of Louis
Seize. The high prices which the several articles brought
are to be attributed rather to their artistic character than
to their extrinsic value as historic relics. They consisted
of Oriental, German, Dresden, Sèvres, Capo di Monte, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
Chelsea china; portraits remarkable for their costumes;
miniatures; mediæval metal-work and ecclesiastical silver;
Limoges, Dresden, and Oriental enamels; carvings in ivory;
Faenza and Palissy ware; armour, arms, and stained glass;
Venetian and German glass, watches, clocks, and compasses,
etc.</p>

<p>Several of the articles brought extraordinary prices.
Among the most costly items were: A Sèvres cabinet,
£465; a pair of Dresden candelabra, £231; a pair of
vases, painted <i>à la Watteau</i>, 95 guineas; King Lothaire’s
magic crystal, bought by Mr. Bernal for 10 guineas, and
once sold in Paris for 12f., brought 225 guineas; Sir
Thomas More’s candlesticks, bought by Mr. Bernal for
12 guineas, were sold for 220 guineas; the celebrated
reliquaire of the King’s, 63 guineas; a metal-gilt Moresque
dish, £57 15<i>s.</i>; a curious steel lock for a shrine, £32;
St. Thomas à Becket’s reliquaire, 27½ guineas; a Limoges
enamel portrait of Catherine di Medicis, 400 guineas; a
Faenza plate, bought at Stowe for £4, brought £120;
a circular Bernard Palissy dish, £162. Among the armour,
steel gauntlets, 50 guineas a pair; a warder’s horn, £56;
and a Spanish breastplate of russet steel, £155. The first
three days the porcelain produced upwards of £6,000; and
about 400 lots of Majolica ware, which cost Mr. Bernal
1,000 guineas, in this sale realized upwards of £7,000,—a
proof of the skill of Mr. Bernal as a collector; and
showing that the purchase of articles of <i>vertu</i>, guided by
correct taste and judgment, may prove a very profitable
means of investment.</p>

<p>Rarely has the dispersion of any assemblage of works
of art realized such high prices as the first portion of Mr.
Bernal’s Collection. In neither of the sales of Mr. Beckford
at Fonthill, at the Strawberry Hill sale (in 1842), or at that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
of Stowe (in 1848), were there assembled so many choice
articles as in the Bernal Collection. Fonthill, Strawberry
Hill, and Stowe included many treasures of historic repute,
more valuable for having been possessed by celebrated
personages than for their perfection as works of art. Mr.
Bernal’s Collection, however, presented higher claims; inasmuch
as his judgment was acknowledged over Europe.
The entire sale realized £62,680 6<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Mr. J. R. Planché, who by request wrote a few introductory
lines to the catalogue, thus speaks of his departed
friend, with whom he had been associated for thirty years:
“Distinguished among English antiquaries by the perfection
of his taste, as well as the extent of his knowledge,
the difficulty of imposing upon him was increased by the
necessity of the fabrication being fine enough in form,
colour, or workmanship to rival the masterpiece it simulated;
to be, in fact, itself a gem of art, which it would
not pay to produce as a relic of antiquity.” Mr. Bernal
was for many years a member of parliament, having sat
successively for Lincoln, Rochester, and Weymouth, and
held the post of Chairman of Committees. In politics he
was a supporter of the Grey and Melbourne ministries.
He died at his house in Eaton Square, on the 25th of
August, 1854.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c163"><i>SALE OF DANIEL O’CONNELLS LIBRARY, PRINTS,<br>
PICTURES, ETC., IN MAY, 1849.</i></p>

<p>The last day’s sale is thus described by the <i>Freeman’s
Journal</i>:—“The auction on Monday concluded the sale
of the standard works, and at its close all were disposed
of save some few insignificant lots for which no bidders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
could be found. A large number of miscellaneous works
of small value were sold in lots at very trifling prices.
One lot, including a number of loose pamphlets and tracts,
many of them bearing O’Connell’s autograph and notes,
sold for £2. The sales of the preceding day were varied.
A number of the Irish and Scottish Art Union prints sold
at prices varying from 2<i>s.</i> to 3<i>s.</i> each. A fine proof copy
of the well-known print, ‘Cross Purposes,’ brought a guinea.
A copy of the now scarce print of ‘Henry Grattan’ fetched
(after some spirited bidding) one guinea, Landseer’s ‘Angler’s
Daughter’ (engraving), 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> ‘The Volunteers in
College Green’ was then put up. This engraving, now scarce,
was keenly competed for; it brought £1 10<i>s.</i> A paltry landscape
painting in oil, ‘The Meeting of the Waters,’ brought
7<i>s.</i> An engraving of Carlo Dolce’s ‘Salvator Mundi’
fetched 6<i>s.</i> A little portrait of that little man, Lord John
Russell, was then put up for competition; but, amongst
a sale-room full of gentry and citizens, not a solitary bidder
was found willing to hazard the risk of even by chance
becoming the possessor of this work of art. The accomplished
salesman displayed the portrait in every possible
light, and solicited an initiatory movement towards setting
Lord John a-going, by infinitesimal beginnings in specie;
but <i>non eundum erat</i>. It was no use; in vain was the
noble lord’s <i>eidolon</i> turned towards each group of by-standers,—in
vain did Mr. Jones insinuate ‘Any advance?’
‘Sixpence for it?’ ‘Eightpence did you say, sir?’ said
the indefatigable Mr. Jones (to an old gentleman with a
white hat). ‘No, sir, I didn’t; nor fourpence,’ replied the
gentleman, angrily. ‘Oh, I beg pardon; well then, fourpence.
Any advance?’ Alas! no; not a solitary bidder.
Even the Liffey Street picture-brokers looked angrily at
this useless and protracted inquiry as to whether there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
was any advance with regard to Lord John. Finally, the
lot was withdrawn. The next lot was a small and handsomely
framed portrait in oils of O’Connell. It seemed
a tolerably clever copy of the well-known medium size
engraving of the original. This picture was put up at a
low figure, but was warmly competed for, and was knocked
down at £1 10<i>s.</i> A large oil painting of the ‘Madonna
and Child,’ not of very high merit, sold for £1. Two
engravings, large size,—one, ‘The Trial of Charles I.,’ the
other, ‘The Trial of Lord Strafford’—sold at 30<i>s.</i> each.
Several other pictures, engravings, and statuettes were sold
at very low prices. A splendid Norman steel cross-bow,
with appurtenances complete, sold for £1 8<i>s.</i> The sales
closed with some miscellaneous articles, none of which
brought beyond average prices. The library, altogether,
was certainly not such, either in the number of the volumes
or their description, as might be supposed to form the
collection of O’Connell; and as to the prices obtained,
they were, as we have before remarked, not beyond the
intrinsic value of each lot, apart from all associations connected
with them.”</p>

<p>Holbein, the painter, once engaged with his landlord
to paint the outside of his house. The landlord found
that the painter left his work very frequently to amuse
himself elsewhere, and determined to keep a constant eye
upon him. Holbein, anxious to get rid of his suspicious
taskmaster, ingeniously contrived to absent himself at the
very time when the landlord fancied he was quietly seated
on the scaffold, by painting two legs apparently descending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
from his seat; and which so completely deceived the man,
that he never thought of ascertaining whether the rest of
the body was in its place.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c165"><i>PALLADIO (ANDREW).</i></p>

<p>Andrew Palladio, the celebrated architect, was born in
1518, at Vicenza, in Lombardy. He learnt the principles
of his art from Trissino; after which he studied at Rome,
and on his return to Lombardy constructed a number of
noble edifices. He was employed in various parts of Italy,
particularly at Venice, where he built the palace Foscari.
His treatise on Architecture was printed at Venice in 1570,
folio; and again at London in 1715, in 3 vols. folio. In
1730, Lord Burlington published some of this architect’s
designs, in one volume folio. Palladio used to relate an
anecdote of an artist who dedicated the different apartments
in a gentleman’s house to several moral virtues, as
Chastity, Temperance, and Honesty; so that each guest might
be appointed to the room sacred to his favourite virtue.
The rich and young widow would be lodged in “Chastity,”
the alderman in “Temperance,” and the prime minister in
“Honesty,” etc. Palladio died in the year 1580. A monument
was erected to his memory at Vicenza, in 1845, the
Count G. Velo having bequeathed 100,000 livres for that
purpose. It is thus described in <i>The Builder</i> in 1846:—</p>

<p>“The statue of Palladio stands on a pedestal, two storeys
in height, with a genius by his side in the act of crowning
him. Seated on the first story of the pedestal, against the
angles of the upper portion, which is less in size than the
lower, are two allegorical figures, one representing Vicenza
with a wreath in her left hand, and looking up with pride at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
the artist; the other Architecture, depicting the history of
the art on a scroll, by a representation of a primitive hut,
and the Pantheon. Between these two figures on the upper
part of the pedestal, is sculptured in bas-relief the baths of
Caracalla, to express that it was by the study of the antique
monuments that Palladio formed himself.</p>

<p>“At the foot of the whole is a sarcophagus, in imitation
of that of Agrippa, containing the remains of the artist.</p>

<p>“The monument stands within an octagon chapel in the
new public cemetery of the city, and is the work of M.
Fabris, a sculptor of Vicenza. The material is Carrara
marble.”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c166"><i>JACQUES CALLOT’S ETCHINGS.</i></p>

<p>“Etching is the writing by which the artist conveys his
thoughts. With etching he can allow himself every liberty
of touch and fantasy. Etching does not freeze his inspiration
by its slow progress: it has all the qualities of a steed
at full gallop. Callot, who was so varied, so original, so
capricious, so fertile, and so ready, is the greatest master of
the art of etching.</p>

<p>“The works of Callot consist of nearly sixteen hundred
plates, including those of Israel. We must pass with the
rapidity of a bird upon the wing almost all his small
religious subjects. Callot, without fantasy, is not himself;
it is plain that he grows tired with works where patience is
required. The subjects in which he revels in all the luxury,
in all the splendour, in all the originality, of his talent, are
‘The Temptation of Saint Anthony,’ ‘The Fair della
Madonna Imprunetta,’ ‘The Tortures,’ ‘The Massacre
of the Innocents,’ ‘The Misfortunes and Horrors of War,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
and tatterdemalions of every form and every kind, from the
hectoring bully to the beggar enveloped in his rags.</p>

<p>“He etched with marvellous facility, having finished on
more than one occasion a plate in a single day. His magic
hand, and his imagination so rich and so quick, often accomplished
a feat of this description in playing, as it were.
It often happened,—as, for instance, in his ‘<i>Livre des
Caprices</i>’ (Book of Caprices), and in his fantastic and
grotesque works,—to let his hand follow its own course.
While chatting with his friends, he would give utterance to
some joke at the same time that he made a stroke, and was
himself lost in wonder at having produced a figure. His
graver, too, was so fertile in resources, that in all his numerous
creations he never repeated himself. He was, however,
an artist who treated his art seriously, and who studied incessantly,
full of his task, and fond of the glimmer of the
midnight lamp. He had the passion of creating tatterdemalions,
bullies, and mountebanks, as other men have the
passion of play. Whenever he sat up to work, he used to
tell his friends that he was going to pass the night in the
bosom of his family.”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c167"><i>THE FEMALE FACE.</i></p>

<p>Felibien, an eminent French writer of the early part of the
17th century, thus describes his <i>beau ideal</i> of the female
ace:—</p>

<p>“The head should be well rounded, and look rather inclining
to small than large. The forehead white, smooth, and
open: not with the hair growing down too deep upon it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
neither flat nor prominent, but like the head, well rounded,
and rather small in proportion than large. The hair either
bright, black, or brown; not thin, but full and waving, and
if it falls in moderate curls the better; the black is particularly
useful for setting off the whiteness of the neck and
skin. The eyes black, chestnut, or blue, clear, bright, and
lively, and rather large in proportion than small. The eyebrows
well divided, rather full than thin; semicircular, and
broader in the middle than at the ends, of a neat turn, but
not formal. The cheeks should not be wide; they should
have a degree of plumpness, with the red and white finely
blended together, and should look firm and soft. The ear
should be rather small than large, well-folded, and with an
agreeable tinge of red. The nose should be placed so as
to divide the face into two equal parts, of a moderate size,
straight, and well squared; though sometimes a little rising
in the nose, which is but just perceivable, may give it a very
graceful look. The mouth should be small, and the lips not
of equal thickness; they should be well turned, small rather
than gross, soft even to the eye, and with a living red in
them. A truly pretty mouth is like a red rose-bud that is
beginning to blow. The teeth should be middle-sized,
white, well-ranged, and even. The chin of a moderate size,
white, soft, and agreeably rounded. The skin in general
should be white, properly tinged with red, with an apparent
softness, and a look of thriving health in it.”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c168"><i>LONDON IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.</i></p>

<p>Sir William Davenant gives a true though ludicrous picture
of the habitations of London in his day:—</p>

<p>“Sure,” says the angry critic, “your ancestors contrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
your narrow streets in the days of wheelbarrows, before the
greater engines, carts, were invented. Is your climate so hot
that as you walk you need umbrellas of tiles to intercept
the sun? Or are your shambles so empty that you are afraid
to take in fresh air, lest it should sharpen your stomachs?
Oh, the goodly landscape of Old Fish Street, which, had it
not the ill-luck to be crooked, was narrow enough to be
your founder’s perspective; and where the garrets (perhaps
not for want of architecture, but through abundance of
amity) are so made that opposite neighbours may shake
hands without stirring from home. Is unanimity of inhabitants
in wise cities better expressed than by their coherence
and uniformity of buildings, where the street begins, continues,
and ends in a like stature and shape? But yours, as
if they were raised in a general insurrection, where every
man hath a separate design, and differ in all things that can
make distinction. There stands one that aims to be a
palace, and next another that professes to be a hovel; here
a giant, there a dwarf; here slender, there broad; and all
most especially different in their faces, size, and bulk. I
was about to defy any Londoner who dares pretend there is
so much ingenious correspondence in this city, as that he
can show me one house like another. Yet your old houses
seem to be reverend and formal, being compared to the
fantastical works of the moderns, which have more ovals,
niches, and angles than are in your custards; and inclosed
in pasteboard walls like those of malicious Turks, who,
because themselves are not immortal, and cannot for ever
dwell where they build, therefore will not be at the charge
to provide such lastingness as may entertain their children
out of the rain; so slight, so prettily gaudy, that if they
could move they would pass for pageants. It is your custom,
where men vary after the mode of their habits, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
turn the nation fantastical; but where streets continually
change fashion you should make haste to chain up the city,
for it is certainly mad.”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c169"><i>TARDIF, THE FRENCH CONNOISSEUR.</i></p>

<p>Among the connoisseurs of pictures who were celebrated
in France towards the end of the seventeenth century, we
must place in the first rank Tardif, formerly an engineer,
but subsequently secretary to the Marshal de Boufflers. He
was the friend of Largillière, Watteau, Audran, and, above
all, of Gillot. He was renowned for the justness of his
criticisms. When a picture was finished, no one dared to
deliver his opinion openly on it, until it had undergone
Tardif’s inspection; his opinion was, so to say, the last
touch of the artist’s brush. Watteau himself, who used to
laugh at criticism, once said on laying down his brush before
a <i>fête galante</i>, still wet, “That picture is a perfect wonder!
If Tardif were here, I would sign it.” Tardif possessed,
in the Rue Gît-le-Cœur, one of the first cabinets of
pictures in Paris. The Marshal de Boufflers, who knew his
secretary’s passion, used every year to make him a present
of the work of some celebrated painter as a new year’s gift.
Tardif, too, had managed to raise sufficient from his patrimonial
fortune to buy pictures from his friends, the living
artists, and of his friends the dead ones. His cabinet was
so celebrated that the Duke of Orleans went one day to see
it with Nocé: this completely turned Tardif’s head. However,
if he had only been subject to this noble kind of madness,
which is a proof of a sublime aspiration towards the
poetry of the beautiful, the worthy creature might have lived
comfortably till his death. But he, too, was afflicted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
the melancholy madness of money for money; he allowed
himself to be fleeced under Law’s system: in other terms,
he lost in that great revolution of French fortunes all he
possessed, save his pictures.</p>

<p>It was necessary for him to live, however. Any one else
would have got rid of his <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i>: Tardif only got rid
of his servants. “Go, my friends,” said he; “the world is
before you. Go where my money is gone. At present, I can
only keep those who do not want to eat; my pictures will
keep me company.” Tardif was already old, the passions
of life had no more influence upon his heart; all that he
needed was a little sunshine in his cabinet for him to live
contented. He died in Paris, May, 1728.—<i>Philosophers

<p class="c sp" id="c170"><i>PAUL POTTER’S STUDIES OF NATURE.</i></p>

<p>When Fergusson, the author of the famous treatise on
perspective, was asked what copies he had followed in
forming his style, he answered, “<i>The examples of great
nature</i>;” and added, “I always found nature <i>so powerful</i>,
that to copy her was easy.” All who have attained greatness
in the practice of art have followed the same course of
study, but none more successfully than our own Edwin
Landseer, who first learned to draw animals in the fields
around Primrose Hill; and Paul Potter, his great prototype,
who acquired his first knowledge of art in the bright green
meadows of the Low Countries. Of the value set by the
latter painter on this mode of study, we have a striking proof
in the picture in which he represents himself making his
first sketch. This great painter was born in 1625, at Enkhuysen,
in the province of Holland. His works, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
have become equally rare and valuable, are peculiarly
distinguished by the effects of his sun rays upon his landscapes
and cattle, in producing which he has distanced all
competitors. His paintings are deemed very valuable. For
one small picture in the collection of the late Marquis of
Westminster, that nobleman gave 9000 guineas. Potter died
in 1654.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c176"><i>FIDELITY IN PORTRAIT PAINTING.</i></p>

<p>It is not always well to paint the whole truth; and although
sincerity is extremely praiseworthy, we can scarcely
approve the somewhat brutal frankness of an old French
artist, who, while taking the portrait of a lady whose face
was slightly broken out, took considerable trouble to reproduce
all the pimples that he saw before him. “My dear
sir,” said the lady, “you are not aware what you are about;
you are painting my pimples; they are merely accidental;
they make no part of my face.” “<i>Bon, bon, madame</i>,”
replied he, “if you hadn’t these you would have others.”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c171"><i>CLAYTON MORDAUNT CRACHERODE.</i></p>

<p>Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode was born in 1729, took his
degree at Oxford in 1753, and though he entered into
orders, he never would accept Church preferment, but
continued to follow his peculiar taste for antiquities, which
an easy competence enabled him to do. His collection of
coins and prints was most various and extensive. The
whole he bequeathed to the British Museum, of which
institution he was a trustee. He is thus described by one
intimately acquainted with him:—“Well do I remember
his mild, benevolent countenance, his sleek black suit, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
his snow-white wig! He was a perfect woman-hater; retraced
his steps when, in coming down stairs, he met one
of the housemaids, and walked out of the room when a
female entered. He was a man of the most regular habits,
and of a sedentary disposition. He possessed a fine estate
in Hertfordshire, and had never ventured to go so far as
to look at it. He often observed that the extent of his
journeys had been to Clapham and Richmond. For forty
years of his life, when not prevented by indisposition, he
daily went to his bookseller and printseller, Elmsley and
Paine, and every Saturday he repaired to Mudge’s, to regulate
his watch.” He died in 1799.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c173"><i>BARRY’S ECCENTRICITY.</i></p>

<p>The eccentricity of Barry is thus spoken of in Daye’s
“Essays on Painting:”—“He carries his ideas of independence
to such an extravagant length as always to pay for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
his dinner at whatever table he sits down. A year or two
ago he dined with Paul Sandby, and laid down eighteenpence
for his dinner, but, on recollection, paid another sixpence,
for his additional quantity of grog. This instance is
by no means singular. His character may be further illustrated.
One evening, at Somerset Place, Peters said, on
coming in, ‘How do you do, Mr. Barry? I hope you are
well.’ On which he grumbled out, ‘Oh! I don’t believe a

‘Go where he will, he always leaves a pearl behind him.’”—Barry

<p class="c sp" id="c174"><i>THE ROYAL PRISONER.</i></p>

<p>Joseph Goupy, an ingenious artist, was born at Nevers,
in France, and painted landscapes much in the style of
Salvator Rosa. He was in great favour with Frederic,
Prince of Wales, and frequently attended at Leicester
House to draw such designs as his Royal Highness chose to
dictate. One morning, on his arrival, the prince said,
“Come, Goupy, sit down and paint me a picture on such a
subject.” But Goupy, perceiving Prince George, afterwards
George III., standing as a prisoner behind a chair, took the
liberty humbly to represent to his royal patron how impossible
it was for him to sit down to execute his commands
with spirit, while the Prince was standing, and under his
royal displeasure. “Come out then, George,” said the
good-natured prince; “Goupy has released you.” When
Goupy was eighty-four, and very poor, he had a mad
woman to nurse and maintain, who had been the object of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
his delight when young; he therefore put himself in the
King’s way at Kensington, where he lived. One morning
the King saw him, and stopped the coach, saying, “How do
you do, Goupy?” asking him also if he had sufficient to live
upon. “Little enough, indeed,” answered Goupy; “and
as I once took your Majesty out of prison, I hope you will
not let me go into one.” His Majesty was graciously
pleased to order him a guinea a week for the remainder of
his life, which, however, was very brief. He died in 1763.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c175"><i>ATHENIAN STUART.</i></p>

<p>Goupy, the subject of the above anecdote, was in his
time considered the most eminent of fan painters. So
fashionable was fan painting at that time, that the family of
Athenian Stuart placed him as a pupil with that artist, conceiving
that by doing so they had made his fortune.
Stuart’s genius, however, in a short time soared to the pinnacle
of fame by flying to Athens for those inestimable
treasures which will immortalize his name, notwithstanding
Hogarth’s satire upon the publication of his first volume;
for, indeed, we have not now a student who speaks of Stuart
without the honourable prefix of “Athenian” to his name.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c177"><i>PRUDHON AND CANOVA.</i></p>

<p>While residing at Rome, Prudhon found a friend in
Canova, his friendship with whom was the most beautiful,
the most noble, the most holy event in his life; in it was
included everything, even to self-sacrifice. It consoled
Prudhon for his misfortunes in love. “There are three
men here,” said Canova to him one day, “of whom I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
jealous.” “I know and love you alone,” replied Prudhon.
“But me alone?” answered Canova; “do you not also
love Raffaelle, and Leonardo da Vinci, and Correggio? You
pass all your time with them, you listen to them, you confide
to them your dreams, you go from one to the other,
and you are never tired of admiring what they produce.”
And this was true, for Prudhon was indefatigable in his study
of these three masters, whom he sometimes called the
Graces. But Correggio was the master whom he loved most.
If Prudhon had listened to Canova, he would have spent
his life at Rome; but in spite of all his friend’s entreaties,
he left, though with a promise soon to return. They never
beheld each other again, but they were faithful in their
friendship: faithful to such a point that they both died at
the same time, as if to meet above. Peter Paul Prudhon
(named after Rubens) was born in 1758, and died in 1823.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c178"><i>REVOLUTION AN ENEMY TO ART.</i></p>

<p>On Prudhon’s return to France his mother was dead, and
his wife, as usual, was not very conjugal. France had ceased
to be a kingdom, and had not yet become a country. It
was the year 1789, and the first rumours of the Revolution
swept over the land like some wind foretelling the coming
storm. It was the hour of exit for the Arts. Prudhon, who
was always resigned, showed his resignation in this instance
as well. After embracing his wife and children he set out
for Paris, believing that at every epoch, even during a revolution,
Paris was the best place for a man to succeed. He
reached that city with scanty means, and took up his quarters
in an hotel which we will dignify by calling it furnished. He
intended to lodge there until he could take a studio; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
got nothing to do, and consequently nothing to eat. He
could not continue this mode of life very long, and therefore,
although proud and very misanthropical, he determined
on applying to the celebrated painters of that period. These
may almost be summed up as consisting of Greuze, David,
and Girodet. He waited upon Greuze, who was from the
same province as himself. “Do you possess talent?” said
Greuze to him. “Yes,” replied Prudhon naïvely. “All
the worse,” continued Greuze. “A family and talent! that
is more than you need to die in want. What the deuce have
you to do with talent at a period when we no longer have a
heaven, nor a devil, nor a king, nor a court, nor poor, nor
rich? I, who address you, am, as you know, as good a
painter as most men; and yet just look at my ruffles!” On
saying this, Greuze, who was a perfect dandy, and excessively
fantastic in his dress, showed Prudhon a pair of ragged ruffles.
“If you did not possess talent,” he continued, “the evil would
not be so great,—you might daub in portraits for the first
comer.” “Did I not say that I had a family?” interrupted
Prudhon. “I will paint sign-boards if it is necessary. I will
turn mechanic as long as it pleases Heaven I shall be one.”
True to his word, Prudhon set up a shop. He painted
miniatures; he designed headings for letters, for concert
tickets, and for bills. He ornamented visiting cards and
sweatmeat boxes. “I undertake,” said he with a melancholy
smile, “all that appertains to my business.”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c179"><i>SERRES AND VERNET.</i></p>

<p>Sir William Beechey related the following anecdote of
Serres, the ship-painter. Serres took a picture or pictures
of shipping from England to the King of France, painted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
to commemorate some naval exploit of the French, and
invited connoisseurs and artists to see his performance.
Among the rest was the famous Vernet. Serres waited some
time after Vernet had looked at the picture, till he became
impatient to hear his opinion, hoping for praise, and fearing
lest it should not be bestowed. “How do you like my
picture, M. Vernet?” said he. “Upon my word, sir,”
replied Vernet, “you paint ropes exceedingly well.”
Nothing could be more satirical, or better mark the genius
of the two men, than this reply. Vernet, like a man of
genius, painted nature at large, and suggested her minutiæ,
but never gave them in detail. Serres was incapable of any
thing but detail, in which he was uncommonly accurate.
Serres thought he revenged himself on Vernet by damning
him for a fool that had never known how to paint a ship;
which, in his sense, was true enough. He could not paint
every shroud, rope, and tackle, etc., all which Serres had
laboriously studied.</p>

<p>Vernet was so attached to his profession that he used to
make voyages in bad weather on purpose to see the sky and
ocean in picturesque perturbation. One day the storm was
so violent that the ship’s crew were in great consternation.
Vernet desired a sailor to bind him to the mast. When
every one was crying and praying, Vernet, with his eyes now
upon the lightning, and now upon the mountainous waves,
continued to exclaim, “How fine this is!”</p>

<p>When Vernet, the celebrated painter, visited Voltaire for
the first time, the author thus addressed him: “Welcome,
M. Vernet! you are rising to immortality, for never were
colours more brilliant or more durable than yours!” The
painter replied, “My colours can never vie with your ink!”
and caught the hand of Voltaire, which he was going to kiss
with reverential awe. But the poet snatched it away, modestly
saying, “What are you going to do? Surely if you kiss my
hand, I must kiss your feet.”</p>

<p>The coronation medal of George IV. afforded an example
worth relating of ingenuity and skill in expedients in the art
of coining. When the gold proof-piece was shown to His
Majesty, he approved of the obverse, which is immensely
flattering, though not so much as he wished, as nothing
satisfied him except Lawrence’s juvenile-looking portrait;
but he immediately remarked that on the reverse proof he
was not properly placed, being on a level with the allegorical
figures of England, Scotland, and Ireland. This the master
of the mint in despair reported to Pistrucci. What was to
be done? There was not time to engrave a new die. After
a moment’s consideration, he said, “I shall elevate His
Majesty.” He then cut the die perpendicularly in two, just
at His Majesty’s foot, slid one piece a little above the other,
so as to raise that part of the platform under the throne
above the other part, and continued the under line of the
platform to make it even, as seen in the reverse of the
published coronation medal.—<i>Dr. Billing’s “Science of Gems.”</i></p>

<p>Charles Townley, born in Lancashire in 1737, resided for
many years at Rome, where he devoted his attention to the
collecting the remains of ancient Art. His collection being
very various, he purchased two houses in Park Street, Westminster,
and there formed a museum for the reception of his
antiquities. His gallery of sculpture was very valuable, he
being a most enthusiastic collector. Such was his ardour in
the pursuit of objects of classic veneration, that it is related
of him that on arriving at Syracuse, harassed and exhausted
by a long journey, he would neither take rest nor food until
he had visited the Fountain of Arethusa. Although a
wealthy man, his mode of living was quiet and frugal in the
extreme. His statues and busts he called his dead family,
and in collecting their remains, and relieving his tenantry,
he expended his whole fortune, and did not even keep a
carriage. He died in 1805 at his museum.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c184"><i>THE TOWNLEY MARBLES.</i></p>

<p>The Elgin marbles, which became public property by
means of public purchase, on the 1st of July, 1816, was the
first unadulterated collection of ancient works of Art possessed
by the nation, and the precursor of other collections
of no less interest to the artist and man of letters. The
Nimroud and Xanthian marbles especially. In these antiques
we behold the real Art of the sculptors of remote
periods; but in the Townley collection, a superficial observer
cannot discover where Greek or Roman Art ceases, and the
ingenuity of Joseph Nollekens commences. Tobacco juice,
cement, and a few discoloured lumps of marble, furnished
tips to the noses of Messalinas, Octavias, and other Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
patrician ladies. Arms, legs, fingers, toes, nails, and sometimes
whole heads, were dexterously supplied by this king
of vampers, who filled his coffers at a time when the rage for
purchasing modern antiques was at its height; therefore,
fortunate indeed was the virtuoso whose antiques were even
a fractional part genuine. Mr. Townley’s marbles were on
this account far superior to many other collections. That
beautiful bust of a female issuing from the petals of a flower,
Mr. Townley justly considered as the gem of his gallery.
During the riots caused by the insane Lord George Gordon,
the mob marked out Mr. Townley’s residence in Park Street
for destruction, the owner being a Roman Catholic. He
secured his cabinet of gems, and casting a long and lingering
look on his cherished marbles, was about to leave them to
their fate, when, moved by some irresistible impulse, he
took this beautiful bust in his arms, and bore it to his
carriage. Fortunately for the nation the contemplated
attack did not take place; Mr. Townley returned with his
“wife,” as he pleasantly called the lady represented, and
restored her to her companions.</p>

<p>The following is said by the <i>Polytechnic Journal</i> to have
taken place at a provincial exhibition in the year 1840:—</p>

<p>“The exhibition rooms were crowded; many visitors paid
for admission, and many claimed exemption by virtue of
brush and palette. Among the latter, two fantastically
dressed persons, like hunters from a neighbouring university,
presented themselves.</p>

<p>“‘What is the number of your work?’ was the question
addressed by the doorkeeper to each exhibitor. ‘Mine is
two hundred and four,’ said one of the applicants.</p>

<p>“‘Then,’ said the unconscious functionary, referring to
his catalogue, ‘you are Mr. Lorraine,—Claude Lorraine?’</p>

<p>“‘<i>Mais précisement,—est ce que vous m’avez déjà connu?</i>’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t exactly understand you,’ replied the other,
‘but will you enter your name in this book?’</p>

<p>“The name was inscribed, as requested, in a hand as
singular as was the writer himself in appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>“The other applicant was no less a personage than Gerhard
Douw, who having registered his name with all the care and
finish which distinguishes him, thanked the doorkeeper in
his best Leyden Dutch, and proceeded to look through the
rooms.</p>

<p>“These were not the only distinguished persons who visited
the rooms; others followed, a few of the names of whom we
learn from a long critique in the local newspapers, a passage
of which we quote: ‘From what we have already stated,
we may consider the success of the experiment as successful
beyond parallel; and such is the interest that the opening
of the exhibition has created, that upon the list of signatures
we find the names of many gentlemen not unknown to the
world. We now may instance those of Lorraine, Douw,
Holbein, Teniers, and Poussin; but propose next week to
discharge more fully this part of our duty, which from the
press of other matter we are now most reluctantly compelled
to postpone.’”</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Townley who had noticed Nollekens at
Rome, kindly continued for years to entertain him at his
house, No. 7, Park Street, Westminster; and when any
person spake of good eating, Mr. Nollekens always gave his
friend Mr. Townley the highest credit for keeping a most
excellent table. “I am sure,” said he, “to make a good
dinner at his house on Sunday; but there is a little man, a
great deal less than myself, who dines there, of the name of
Devay, a French Abbé, who beats me out and out. He is
one of the greatest gormandizers I ever met with; though,
to look at him, you would declare him to be in the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
deplorable state of starvation.” The Abbé Devay was an
excellent man; he conversed and wrote in many languages;
and his reading and memory were so extensive and useful,
that Mr. Townley, who referred to him in his literary concerns,
always called him his “walking library.” The Sunday
dinners of Mr. Townley were principally for professors of

<p>“What is an artist? Oh, everybody knows what an

everybody does not so clearly know. I have already defined
my meaning in the term, but perhaps you have net yet felt
the fulness of the definition; and illustration may be useful.</p>

<p>“In a lone room, damp-walled and fireless,—the midnight
wind of March howling without,—cold, but not feeling it,—cheerless,
comfortless, but senseless to such,—there sits,
perhaps a youth, perhaps an aged man. A book lies open,
and his red eyes greedily devour the thought. Or it is a
picture that he muses on; perhaps a statue, a carving, a
device; perhaps (although it may seem wonderful) a building.
Or he writes,—ponders and writes; or draws,—ponders
and draws. Or it is music that he loves,—sweet melody—soft
harmony—in the still night, when grosser men have
ceased their turmoil’s jarring discord. How intent he is!
He forgets the world—forgets himself—forgets the cold
March night—-in some strange lore! The chill of opening
spring is but as the warmth of kindest, sunniest Autumn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
That cheerless home of his is lost—lost in the vision of a
beautiful heaven. The bleak black noon of night is <i>without</i>!
within it is a brilliant daylight scene; and he is very happy!
He is alone with Art,—his soul surrounded with the beautiful.
He is drunk with love of Loveliness as with a drug. Sorcery-struck,
the earthy of him sleeps, and the supernal self is
breathing a celestial air. <i>He</i> is not in the dim, damp

<p>A husband wishing to surprise a beloved wife on her
birthday, came to Sully, the painter, and got him to paint
his portrait “on the sly.” It was begun forthwith, and
Sully was to have it carried home and put up while the wife
was out. But before it was half done, the wife paid him
a visit by stealth. “Pray, Mr. Sully,” said she, “could
you not contrive, think you, to make a portrait of me by
such a day (Sully stared), for that is my birthday, and I
should like of all things to surprise my husband,” “Why,—a—a,”
said Sully, seeing that she had no idea of the trick,
“I do believe that I could; and if you will manage to draw
your husband away the night before, I will have the picture
hung up for you and all ready to receive you in the morning.”
“Delightful!” said she. To work he went therefore,
and so closely was he run that once or twice he had to let
the husband out of one door on tiptoe, while the wife was
creeping in at another on tiptoe. Well, the portraits were
finished: they were very like. The night before the birthday
arrived, and Sully finding both parties away, each being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
decoyed away by the other, hung them up (the pictures, not
the parties) in their superb frames, just where they required
to be hung. The rest of the story we may as well skip,—for
who shall describe the surprise of both, when the wife got
up early, and the husband got up early, both keeping their
countenances to a miracle, and each feigned an excuse to
lead the other into the room where the two portraits
appeared side by side!—<i>Monthly Magazine</i>, 1826.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c191"><i>THE IDEAL PART OF PAINTING.</i></p>

<p>“Painting is an act that leads to infinite exertion, and the
perfection of it appears difficult to be ascertained. The
grandest performances of the greatest masters cannot circumscribe
the limits of the art. Raphael has executed
prodigious works; but yet we dare to think that he may be
excelled, and this great man laboured every day of his life,
with a hope to surpass himself. I am certain that had his
life, which was a short one, been extended to ever so great
a length, and had his progress in his art kept pace with his
increasing years, the idea of perfection which he cherished
would have prevented him from being satisfied with what
he had, and he would always have aimed at further improvement.
No one but a painter can imagine this infinite
process in the art: other men consider it as confined to
very narrow limits. The artist himself sees his toil expanding
itself every moment into infinite extent. This art
may be compared to geography; where a dot stands for a
city, a sea, or a kingdom.”</p>

<p>In confirmation of this opinion of Charpentier on the
infinite progress of the ideal part of painting, let us hear
the sentiment of a painter of our own country: “I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
there never was such a race of men upon the face of the
earth; never did men look and act like those we see represented
in the works of Raphael, Michael Angelo, Correggio,
Parmegiano, and others of the best painters; yet nature
appears throughout. We rarely or never see such landscapes
as those of Titian, Annibal Caracci, Salvator Rosa,
Claude Lorraine, Jasper, Poussin, and Rubens; such buildings,
in magnificence, as in the pictures of Paul Veronese;
but yet there is nothing but what we can believe may be.
Our ideas even of fruits, flowers, insects, draperies, and
indeed of all visible things, and of some that are invisible,
or creatures of the imagination, are raised and improved in
the hands of a good painter; and the mind is thereby filled
with the noblest, and therefore the most delightful images.”—<i>See

<p>Vandermyne, the Dutch painter, was taken into Yorkshire
by a Mr. Aislesby, to paint him some pictures; but he
committed such excesses that he was at length turned out
of doors. Under these circumstances he went to a draper
at York, where he had frequently been with his patron, and
took goods for clothing on credit; and as in conversation
he discovered that the draper had saved a few hundred
pounds, he persuaded him to part with it, promising him
five per cent.: then getting a tailor recommended to make
the clothes, he afterwards decamped in a hurry. It was
some months before Mr. Aislesby had occasion to go to
York; and when he called on the draper, the latter ventured
to ask after the gentleman, when the other exclaimed he
had turned the rascal out of doors for his drunkenness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
dissolute conduct. On this an explanation took place, and
the man was advised to get a picture for his money, as the
painter was no farther off than Scarborough. The advice
was followed, and he found the artist, who, after a bottle,
painted before he left him a large head of <i>Satan after the
Fall</i>. This picture was exhibited gratis at the draper’s
house at York, and by the company it attracted amply
repaid him. The poor tailor, who lived opposite, and had
made the clothes, being mortified at the other’s success,
determined to walk over to Scarborough to see if he also
could get a picture. On being introduced to the artist, he
begged with many bows and scrapes that as the artist had
painted a picture for his neighbour that was likely to make
his fortune, he would likewise paint one for him; and as
his account was not so great as the other’s, he observed
that he could not expect so large a one; but added, if he
would be so good as to paint him <i>a little devil</i>, he should
be much obliged. The whim took; he got a small picture
and returned to York, where both pictures were exhibited
with great <i>éclat</i>. He died in Moorfields, 1783, aged 68.</p>

When told that partridges always sat on the ground, he said,
“That might be; but it looks so much more picturesque to
have a landscape in the background; and I can’t alter it,
for an extraordinary bird ought to have an extraordinary
situation; it exalts him above his fellows.”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c195"><i>PAINTING A SKY.</i></p>

<p>The following amusing anecdote is given in a volume of
the <i>Polytechnic Journal</i>:—</p>

<p>“<i>S’entr’aider</i> is not uncommon in the English School,
where points of departure from an artist’s ordinary habits of
work create a feeling of diffidence; but it rarely occurs that
the two names attach to the work. Sometimes the commonest
objects create intense difficulty when an artist is
fastidious and jealous of all foreign assistance; for instance,
to <span class="allsmcap">PAINT A SKY</span> is the halting point of one of our artists
who is in the enjoyment of a certain degree of celebrity.
This, his foible, became known to us through a mutual
acquaintance, who, calling one day at his house, had the
door opened to him by a female domestic, whose eyes were
red with weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“‘Is Mr. —— at home?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir, but—but—he’s <i>painting a sky</i>, sir;’ and up
went the apron to her eyes as she began to whine anew.</p>

<p>“It struck the visitor that something must be ‘out of joint.’
As he was hurrying to the well-known <i>studio</i>, the girl hastily
exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“‘O pray,—please sir, don’t go up; it’s not safe,—he’s
<i>painting a sky</i>, and he doesn’t see nobody on sky-days.’</p>

<p>“This expostulation had its effect. ‘Well, well,’ said the
other, ‘if Mr. —— has given orders not to be interrupted,
make my compliments, and say I will call in the evening.’</p>

<p>“The evening came and the daylight went, and the would-be
visitor addressed himself again to the painter’s knocker,
under the impression that there was then certainly not light
enough for ‘painting a sky.’</p>

<p>“The door was opened as before, and the applicant was
about, unhesitatingly, to proceed to his friend’s studio, when
he was again encountered by the servant’s deprecating
accents.</p>

<p>“‘What! not to be seen yet?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh no, sir; master’s skying away like a madman.
He’ll be the death of us all.’</p>

<p>“It was ultimately agreed that the visitor should wait a
little in a lower room, as the artist’s usual hour of relaxation
from professional employment was already past. The room
into which he was shown was immediately below the studio,
and he took up a book, but from the noise overhead he
found it impossible to read. The painter was pacing up and
down in precipitate and violent action, and from the noise
and sound of splinters, heavy objects of furniture were
undoubtedly smashed; lighter ones seemed to be kicked
about with the fury and increased power of a maniac; the
door, too, was slammed with fearful violence, and from time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
to time the shivered glass of the windows fell upon the
pavement.</p>

<p>“The visitor became alarmed. He was rushing upstairs,
when he was met by a young child who was wailing and
lamenting aloud, as if he had been severely beaten.</p>

<p>“‘What can be the reason of all this?’ demanded our
friend.</p>

<p>“‘Oh! Pa’s <i>painting a sky</i>,—pa’s <i>painting a sky</i>,’ was all, in
his excessive grief, the boy could utter. While yet condoling
with the child, another, younger, rushed downstairs with
a rapidity sufficient to endanger its neck,—the cry as before,
‘Pa’s painting a sky.’</p>

<p>“The second child was followed by Mrs. ——, who
apologised for the prevailing confusion; ‘but,’ added she,
‘this is so often the case when Mr. —— has to paint a sky,
that it is my most fervent prayer he may never paint
another.’</p>

<p>“The tears stood in the good lady’s eyes; and scarcely had
she finished speaking when an unlucky dog was hurled from
above, filling the house with his shrill and piteous howlings;
and, lastly, the cat descended with a like precipitation. Our
friend, despairing of meeting the artist in a rational state,
now took his hat, his departure, and a resolution to visit him
some other day when his employment was not ‘painting a
sky.’”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c196"><i>VARIETY OF SKIES.</i></p>

<p>Ambrose Philips, the poet, was, in his conversation, solemn
and pompous. At a coffee-house he was once discoursing
upon pictures, and pitying the painters who in their
historical pieces always drew the same sort of sky. “They
should travel,” said he, “and then they will see that there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
a different sky in every country,—in England, France, Italy,
and so forth.” “Your remark is just,” said a grave old
gentleman who sat by: “I have been a traveller, and can
testify what you observe is true; but the greatest variety of
<i>skys</i> that I found was in Poland.” “In Poland, sir?” said
Philips. “Yes, in Poland; for there are Sobie<i>sky</i>, Poniatow<i>sky</i>,
Sarbrun<i>sky</i>, Jablon<i>sky</i>, Podebra<i>sky</i>, and many more
<i>skys</i>, sir, than are to be found anywhere else.”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c197"><i>SLANG OF ARTISTS.</i></p>

<p>The conversation of artists, when it has reference to their
profession, is usually patched up with phrases peculiar to
themselves, and which may not be improperly called Slang
of Art. This jargon, when heard by persons unacquainted
with its application, is apt to lead to awkward mistakes. A
laughable instance of this kind once occurred. A party of
artists were travelling in a stage-coach, in which, besides
themselves, a sedate venerable lady was the only passenger.
The conversation among the artists ran as follows:—“How
playful those clouds are!” “That group to the left is sweetly
composed, though perhaps a little too solid and rocky for
the others.” “I have seen nothing of L——’s lately. I think
he is clever.” “He makes all his flesh too chalky.” “You
must allow, however, that he is very successful with his ladies.”
The old lady began to exhibit symptoms of uneasiness, and
at the close of each observation cast an anxious and inquiring
look at the speaker. Her companions, however, unconscious
of the surprise they were exciting (for she entertained
doubts as to their sanity), went on in the same style. She
heard them, to her increasing dismay, talk of a farm-house
coming out from the neighbouring trees, and of a gentleman’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
grounds wanting repose. At length they approached
an old village church. A great many observations were
made about the keeping, etc., of the scene, which the old
woman bore with tolerable equanimity; but at last one of
the party exclaimed, in a kind of enthusiasm, “See how well
the woman in the red cloak carries off the tower.” The lady
screamed to the coachman to stop, paid him his fare, although
advanced only half way on her journey, and expressed her
thankfulness for having escaped alive from such a set of
madmen.</p>

<p>Much false wit and unjust strictures have been made on
lovers of the olden time, as if they were all alike nugatory
and tiresome. Many antiquaries have proved men of great
sense and ingenuity. Let two modern ones plead the cause
of antiquarianism,—the poets Gray and T. Warton. Cervantes
has well described foolish and useless researches into
antiquity: “Say no more, sir,” says Sancho, “for in good
faith if I fall to questioning and answering, I shall not have
done between this and to-morrow morning; for foolish
questions and ridiculous answers I need not be obliged to
any of my neighbours.” “Sancho,” quoth Don Quixote,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
“you have said more than you are aware of; for some there
are who tire themselves with examining into and explaining
things, which, after they are known and explained, signify
not a farthing to the <i>understanding</i> or <i>memory</i>.”</p>

<p>A gentleman showing his friend his curiosities, pictures,

The stranger fixed his election upon a tablet, in which the
Ten Commandments were written in letters of gold. “You

am bound to keep.”</p>

<p class="c less">“Their Venus must be old, and want a nose.”—<i>Foote.</i></p>

<p>Antiquaries are by no means apt to pay great attention to
the fair sex; among those who have set themselves most
warmly against that elegant part of the creation, must be
reckoned Antony à Wood, whose diary affords some instances
of his dislike, so grotesque that they claim attention.</p>

<p>Page 167. “He (Sir Thomas Clayton), and his family,
most of them womankind (which before were looked upon,
if resident in the college, as a scandal and abomination thereto),
being no sooner settled, etc., etc., the warden’s garden
must be altered, new trees planted, etc., etc. All which,
though unnecessary, yet the poor college must pay for
them; and all this to please a woman!”</p>

<p>Page 168. “Frivolous expenses to pleasure his proud
lady.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>Page 173. “Yet the warden, by the motion of his lady,
did put the college to unnecessary charges, and very frivolous
expenses: among which were a very large looking-glass,
for her to see her ugly face and body to the middle, and
perhaps lower.”</p>

<p>Page 252. “Cold entertainment, cold reception, cold
clownish woman.”</p>

<p>Page 257. “Dr. Bathurst took his place of Vice-Chancellor,
a man of good parts, and able to do good things, but
he has a wife that scorns that he should be in print. A
scornful woman! Scorns that he was Dean of Wells! No
need of marrying such a woman, who is so conceited that
she thinks herself fit to govern a college or a university.”</p>

<p>The learned Selden has left no good example to antiquaries,
in point of gallantry. “It is reason,” says he, “a
man that will have a wife should be at the charge of her
trinkets, and pay all the scores she sets on him. He that
will keep a monkey, it is fit he should pay for the glasses he
breaks.”—<i>European Magazine.</i></p>

<p class="c sp" id="c202"><i>POETS AND PAINTERS.</i></p>

<p>The visible emotions that poets are subject to, during the
ardour of composition, are not to be ridiculed as grimaces,
for they certainly assist to put the fancy in motion. Nor
are they to be considered as the struggles of the mind
against its own want of fertility; they often proceed from
the powers being under very animated exertion. Quintilian
compares these agitations to the lashing of a lion’s tail,
bestowed on his own back to excite and prepare himself for
a combat. Dominichino used to act the parts of the personages
he was about to represent by his pencil; to use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
such action, to utter such speeches, as he conceived their
situation and character would demand. And when he was
employed on the picture of the <i>Martyrdom of St. Andrew</i>,
Caracci, coming into his room, surprised him in one of
these assumed characters. His voice thundered, and his
attitude was fierce and threatening; he was then preparing
to paint the figure of a soldier menacing the saint. When
this fit of enthusiasm had subsided, Caracci ran to embrace
this great painter, and declared that he should consider him
from that time his master, and that he had that day caught
from him the true method of designing expression.</p>

<div class="figcenter2">

</div>


<p class="c sp" id="c203"><i>FREEDOM OF OPINION.</i></p>

<p>Sir Martin Archer Shee, in his “Rhymes on Art,” remarks:—“There
is no enjoying a picture in peace while the
proprietor is expatiating on its beauties. All pleasure is
destroyed, all improvement prevented, when—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Neither politeness nor prudence will allow you to dissent,
however erroneous you may think his remarks, or misplaced
his panegyric; for, in the present day, when old pictures
bear a price so extraordinary, to hint a doubt of the various
and often incompatible merits which the owner of the celebrated
work chooses to ascribe to it, seems not only an
insult but an injury, since it tends to depreciate his property,
as well as to disparage his taste.” An amusing
instance of this difficulty of forming an independent opinion
is given in Richardson’s “Discourses on the Science of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
Connoisseur.” “Some years since, a very honest gentleman
(a rough man) came to me, and amongst other discourse,
with abundance of civility invited me to his house.
‘I have,’ said he, ‘a picture by Rubens; ’tis a rare good
one. Mr. —— came t’other day to see it, and says ’tis a
copy. G—d d—n him, if any one says that picture is a
copy, I’ll break his head! Pray, Mr. Richardson, will you
come, and give me your opinion of it?’”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c204"><i>THE CONNOISSEUR TAKEN IN.</i></p>

<p>One day, at an exhibition in Brussels, there was a gentleman
very finely dressed, who seemed uncommonly attentive
to every picture, and condemned, like a modern critic, <i>ad
libitum</i>. Coming at last over against a highly-finished piece of
fruit and flowers, with insects placed upon some of the
leaves, he lifted up his right hand, and applied his eye-glass,
which was set in silver, and curiously chased round the rim;
on the little finger of the other hand, which held the
catalogue, he had an antique, set round with rich brilliants.
After he had pored over the picture for some time, he exclaimed,
“Oh, horribly handled!—the colouring is execrable.
Was this thing done for a fly? never was anything half so
wretched. A fly! nothing was ever more out of nature.”—This
speech brought a group of listeners about him: he
then pointed to that part of the picture where this insect
was executed in so abominable a manner; on the approach
of his finger, the ill-done reptile flew away, for it happened
to be a real fly.</p>

<p>Lord Chesterfield happened to be at a rout in France,
where Voltaire was one of the guests. Chesterfield
seemed to be gazing about the brilliant circle of ladies, when
Voltaire thus accosted him: “My lord, I know you are a

<p class="c sp" id="c206"><i>THE UNCOURTLY MEDALIST.</i></p>

<p>“One day,” says the Duchess d’Orleans in her letters,
“Mareschal de Villars came to see me. As he was esteemed
a connoisseur in medals, and wished to examine my collection,
I sent for Baudelot, a worthy man who takes care of
them for me, and bade him show them to the mareschal.
Baudelot is no courtier, is utterly ignorant of the tales of the
day, and of consequence knows nothing of M. de Villars’
domestic uneasiness. He began with acquainting the
mareschal that he had written a dissertation to prove a
certain antique horned bust, was not meant for Jupiter
Ammon, but for Pan. ‘Ah, sir,’ said he next, ‘this is one
of our most curious coins. It is the triumph of Cornificius;
he has all sorts of horns; he has the horns of Jove
and of Faunus. Observe him, sir: he, like you, was a
great general.’”——“I would fain,” says the duchess,
“have turned the conversation, but Baudelot persisted in it,
till all the company were forced to leave the room, that they
might indulge their propensity to laugh; nor was it without
difficulty that, after Villars was gone, I could convince my
medalist of his impropriety in talking of horns before so
celebrated a cuckold.”—<i>European Magazine.</i></p>

<p>To form a judgment of pictures, it seems reasonable, no
doubt, that the connoisseur should be acquainted with the
original subjects. Yet how many persons, who have
scarcely seen more of nature than the Parks and Kensington
Gardens, give their opinions of the beautiful landscapes
of the Poussins and Claude, and venture their criticism on
their faults! This fact brings to remembrance a story of a
gentleman from the Heralds’ College, who was much disappointed
on the view of the lions in the Tower, as he
found them so very different from what he had used to
delineate them,—rampant, couchant, etc., at the college.</p>

<p>The purchasers of these rare commodities, if they are
not irreclaimable antiquaries, have little reason to defend
their very unaccountable propensities to dust and bookworms.
An author is scarce, either because in course of
time the edition has been sold, and by neglect and accidents
lost to the public, and no one has thought it worth while to
reprint it; or because the edition was very expensive, and
in the first place consisted of few copies. If mere antiquity
and scarceness are the grounds on which these very curious
purchasers proceed, we might expect, provided they were
well gilt and in good condition, they would seek their wives
among the venerable and scarce specimens of ancient

<p>It may with truth be observed that those who have lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
themselves in the study of antiquities seem to have dropped
their connection with the world around them, and, like
ghosts, to hover round the tombs of their deceased friends,
which they honour in proportion to the remoteness of their
decease. Lord Monboddo, the metaphysician, a great
admirer of the ancients, has professed this taste of “time-honoured”
connections in the most ample and singular
manner. Speaking of Greek and Latin Dictionaries, his
lordship says, “I reckon such dictionary-makers, by whose
industry we are enabled to live in the ancient world, one of

<p class="c sp" id="c211"><i>THE CHANDOS PORTRAIT OF SHAKSPEARE.</i></p>

<p>The history of this very interesting and renowned portrait
is as follows. It is presumed to be the work of Richard
Burbage, the first actor of <i>Richard III.</i>, who is known to
have handled the pencil. It then became the property of
Joseph Taylor, the poet’s <i>Hamlet</i>, who, dying about the
year 1653, left it by will to Sir William Davenant, the poet,
who was born 1605, and died 1668. He was a professed
admirer of Shakspeare; and his elder brother (Parson
Robert) had been heard to relate, as Aubrey informs us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
that Shakspeare had often kissed Sir William when a boy.
At the death of Sir William Davenant, in 1668, it was bought
by Betterton, the great actor, belonging to the Duke’s
Theatre, of which Davenant was the patentee; and when he
died, Mr. Robert Keck, of the Inner Temple, gave Mrs.
Barry, the actress, who had it from Betterton, forty guineas
for it. From Mr. Keck it passed to Mr. Nicol, of Minchenden
House, Southgate, whose only daughter and heiress, Mary,
married James, Marquess of Carnarvon, afterwards Duke of
Chandos, from whom it descended in right of his second
wife, Anna Eliza, to the late Duke of Buckingham and
Chandos. It is a small portrait on canvas, 22 inches long
by 18 broad. The face is thoughtful, the eyes are expressive,
and the hair is of a brown black, the dress is black
with a white turnover collar, the strings of which are loose.
In the left ear is a small gold ring. It fetched, at the Duke
of Buckingham’s sale at Stowe, in September, 1848, the
princely sum of 355 guineas. The Earl of Ellesmere was
the purchaser, and it now forms part of the grand collection
of pictures at Bridgwater House, in the Green Park.</p>

on the 30th April 1870:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ESSRS. CHRISTIE, MANSON, &amp; WOODS, respectfully
give notice that they will SELL by
AUCTION, at their great Rooms, King Street, St. James’s
Square, on Saturday, April 30th, at 3 o’clock, the FELTON
PORTRAIT of SHAKSPEARE. This celebrated picture
forms part of an estate in course of administration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
under orders of the Court of Chancery. It is generally
supposed to be the portrait from which Droeshout engraved
his plate, the first portrait published of Shakspeare, and
has the reputation of Ben Jonson’s testimony of its resemblance
to the immortal bard,—‘This figure, that thou here
seest put, it was for gentle Shakspeare cut; wherein the
graver had a strife with nature, to out-doo the life: O,
could he but have drawn his wit as well in brasse, as he
hath hit his face; the print would then surpass all that
was ever writ in brasse.’ The picture is painted on wood,
life-size, little more than the countenance remaining. On
the back is an inscription in old writing, ‘Gu. Shakspeare,
1597.—R. B.’; presumed to be Richard Burbage, a well-known
player and artist, contemporary with Shakspeare,
and to whom report has always given the honour of painting
the only portrait for which Shakspeare sat.”</p></div>

<p>The picture had but few admirers, and realized only fifty
pounds.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c213"><i>PARISIAN CARICATURISTS.</i></p>

<p>In March, 1851, a singular circumstance occurred in
Paris, namely, the conviction and sentencing of Charles
Vernier, the caricaturist on the <i>Charivari</i>, to a fine of 100
francs and two months’ imprisonment. His crime was
designing a head of the Constitution. M. Léon Faucher
and other politicians were shooting arrows at this wonderful
mark. The President was handing them the arrows.
Underneath was written, “Who upsets it completely shall
be my minister.” M. Leopold Pannier, the editor, was
condemned to pay 2000 francs fine, and suffer six months’
imprisonment. The passion of the French for political
ferment must be extraordinary to require such severity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
exercised towards the press and the arts, added to an extensive
system of espionage, which appears to pervade
every society of every grade throughout France. Where
“Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity,” are upon every lip, we
find French citizens amerced and imprisoned for an offence
which in England, monarchical England, is allowed to pass
unnoticed. Our caricaturists, had they been in France,
would have been pillaged of every farthing, and rotted in a
felon’s gaol, for producing merely a tithe of the bold, political
hits at royalty, the ministry, and the political events
of the French war, during the reigns of George III.
and George IV. The most biting caricatures were
thrown off by thousands within a stone’s throw of the
palace of St. James’s, and wet impressions taken to the
King, whose good nature was above making war upon Art,
even if his knowledge of the English character, and the
experience of many years—from the days of Sir Robert Walpole—had
not shown him that disappointment, or even
public spleen, is harmlessly dissipated by a laugh and a
stinging article from some journal,—the true safety-valve for
the expression of public hatred to political partisans or
measures.—<i>Almanac of the Fine Arts.</i></p>

<p class="c sp" id="c214"><i>ITALIAN POTTERY AND GLASS-MAKING.</i></p>

<p>The early celebrity of Italian pottery is attested by the
French word for earthenware,—<i>faïence</i>,—which is only a
corruption of the name of the Italian town, Faenza; and its
flourishing condition in past ages is shown by the works
now so eagerly sought for, in which the genius of Italian
art is displayed. But the present commercial importance of
this branch of industry in Italy does not equal the historical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
interest that belongs to it. Production is limited, not exceeding
the value of 3,200,000 francs in porcelain and
earthenware of all kinds; while the value of importations
from foreign countries amounts to a somewhat larger sum,
One porcelain manufactory, that of Doccia, near Florence,
seems to deserve special notice, This establishment, the
property of the Marquis Ginovi, is chiefly remarkable for
the successful imitations which it produces of old majolica.
The total annual value of the articles made in it is estimated
at about 320,000 francs. The introduction of the art of
glass-making into modern Europe is due to the Venetians,
who, until comparatively late times, enjoyed an undisputed
superiority in it. They discovered the means of rendering
glass colourless by the employment of manganese. They
had the monopoly of mirrors, the silvering of which was a
secret long kept from other countries, But the mirrors of
Venice have now lost their reputation, the manufacturers of
this place being unable to produce plates equal in dimensions
to those made by their foreign competitors. Glass
beads became at an early period an important article of
trade with Africa and the East. They are still made in
considerable quantities for exportation. Venetian enamels
have always been famous, and among the peculiar productions
of this place may be reckoned the beautiful composition
called Aventurine, the secret of which is said to be in
the possession of a single manufacturer. Some articles,
such as beads, are made to a certain extent in the city of
Venice itself; but the great glass works are to be found at
Murano, one of the islands of the lagoon. This little
island, which had at one time 30,000 inhabitants, formerly
enjoyed a sort of local independence, with distinct laws and
institutions. It had a wealthy nobility of its own, whose
names were inscribed in a separate golden book. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
privileges have disappeared, its population and riches have
declined, but its industrial establishments are still active,
and show signs of prosperity. Before the fall of the old
Venetian republic, the glassmakers constituted a close corporation
with exclusive privileges. The trade was thrown
open in 1806 under the government of the then kingdom of
Italy, and a period of keen competition and low prices
ensued, until the year 1848, when the conditions of the
trade were regulated by an agreement among the manufacturers.
The number of persons employed in glass-making
at Murano and Venice is 5000, of whom one-third are
men, and two-thirds women and children. The highest
wages are, for men, 12 francs; for women, 1 franc 50 centimes;
the lowest for men, 2 francs, and for women, 75
centimes. The annual cost of the substances employed in
the manufacture is estimated at between 6,000,000 and
7,000,000 francs, and that of the fuel consumed at 600,000
francs. The gross receipts obtained come to little more
than double this aggregate amount. The principal markets
for Venetian glass are in France, England, Germany, and,
above all, in the East, where there is a constant demand
for the beads and other articles known by the denomination
of “conterie.” The above facts are taken from the interesting
report by Mr. Herries, published in a recently issued
series of consular reports.—<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p class="c sp" id="c215"><i>THE PORTLAND VASE.</i></p>

<p>The Portland Vase is a beautiful cinerary urn of transparent
dark blue glass, found about the middle of the sixteenth
century, in a marble sarcophagus near Rome. It
was at first deposited in the Barberini Palace at Rome (and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
hence often called the “Barberini Vase”): it then became
(1770) the property, by purchase, of Sir William Hamilton,
from whose possession it passed into that of the Duchess of
Portland. In 1810, the Duke of Portland, one of the
trustees of the British Museum, allowed it to be placed in
that institution, retaining his right over it as his own property.
In 1845, William Lloyd dashed this valuable relic
to pieces with a stone. Owing to the defective state of the
law, only a slight punishment could be inflicted; but an act
was immediately passed making such an offence punishable
with imprisonment for two years; and one, two, or three
public or private whippings. The pieces of the fractured
vase were carefully gathered up, and afterwards united in
a very complete manner, and thus repaired. It still exists
in the Museum, but is not shown to the public.</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c216"><i>A LOST ART.</i></p>

<p>The most remarkable Chinese porcelain is the Kiasing,
or azure pressed; the secret of its manufacture has been
lost, but the specimens which are preserved are of inestimable
value. The art was that of tracing figures on the china,
which are invisible until the vessel is filled with liquid.
The porcelain is of the very thinnest description,—almost as
thin as an egg-shell. It is said that the application in
tracing these figures is internal, and not by external painting,
as in ordinary manufacture; and that after such tracing
was made, and when it was perfectly dry, a very thin covering
or coating was laid over it of the same paste of which
the vessel had been formed, and thus the painting lay
between two coatings of chinaware. When the internal
coating became sufficiently dry, they oiled it over, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
shortly after placed it in a mould and scraped the exterior
of the vessel as thin as possible, without penetrating to the
painting, and then baked it in the oven. It is evident that
if such be the mode that was adopted, it would require the
nicest dexterity and patient care, for which the Chinese are
remarkable; but, although they constantly endeavour to
recover the exact method, their trials have been hitherto
unavailing.—<i>Sirr’s “China and the Chinese.”</i></p>

<p class="c sp" id="c217"><i>FANS.</i></p>

<p>Old English and French fans are both scarce and costly;
in 1865 a collection of old French fans, painted by Boucher
and Watteau, was sold by Messrs. Foster at prices varying
from £6 to £30 each; the set of fourteen fans fetching as
much as £195. Recently, three old French fans were sold
by Messrs. Christie and Manson for the large sum of 55
guineas.</p>

<p>An Exhibition of Fans on loan took place at the South
Kensington Museum in May, 1870, a collection both curious
and interesting; the objects of the promoters being to encourage
a taste for fans of elegant and artistic designs,
and to promote the employment of female artists in their
manufacture. Much has been done by Mr. Cole and his
able co-adjutors to foster a correct taste, and enable those
who follow Art, as a means of livelihood, to obtain true
artistic instruction. The number of fans in the collection
consisted of over five hundred, many being works of high
Art; and it was astonishing to see what little effect time had
had on these little frail and perishable articles of luxury.</p>

<p>Her Majesty the Queen, the Empress of the French,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
the Comtesse de Chambrun, and Lady Wyatt, alone contributed
over one hundred and fifty, all of exquisite design
and workmanship.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel Redgrave, in his Introduction to the Catalogue,
says, “The present Exhibition is part of the scheme of the
Department of Science and Art for the Art Instruction of
Women. To promote this object, the Department offered
prizes in competition for fans painted by the students in the
Female Schools of Art in 1868, and again in 1869.” Her
Majesty the Queen, the Baroness Meyer de Rothschild,
Lady Cornelia Guest, and the Society of Arts also offered
prizes for competition at the International Exhibition of the
present year (1871), which have produced many designs of
great merit.</p>

<p>The use of the fan has been traced back to very ancient
times. They are evidently of Eastern origin, and are absolutely
necessary in the East, to temper in some degree the
fierce heat of the sun. But from tropical regions they found
their way at an early date into Europe, and were in use at
Rome at least as early as the second century before Christ,
when they are mentioned by Terence in one of his comedies.
One of the oldest fans preserved to the present day is that
of Theodelinda, a queen of Lombardy, who lived in the
latter part of the sixth century. It is preserved at Monza,
the ancient capital of the kingdom of Lombardy, and is
made of purple vellum, embellished with gold and silver.</p>

<p>The fan has served a variety of purposes besides its
natural use of producing a cool breeze. Spanish ladies,
who are accustomed to attend bull-fights, carry with them
fans containing a programme of the entertainment, and
adorned with portraits both of the bulls and the fighters.
In Japan they serve many uses, from being a rod in the
hands of the schoolmaster, to a receptacle for alms in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
of the beggar. The fan has been largely used, too, in
religious ceremonies. In the middle ages it was customary
to wave a fan over the elements of the Sacrament. Fans of
this description were attached to long handles, often elaborately
worked in gold and silver. On great occasions, when
the Pope is carried in state through the streets of Rome, he
is preceded by large fans made of peacock feathers, and
said to be copies of ancient fans used in the temple of
Jupiter. And in the Greek Church, when a deacon is
ordained, a fan is given to him, part of his duty being to
keep off flies and other insects from the superior priests
when celebrating the Sacrament. The custom is carried
out in all parts of Russia, though, as has been observed, the
office must, in that climate, be a sinecure, at least for great
part of the year.</p>

<p>In the middle ages, fans were made of feathers, and their
chief ornamentation was in the handles, which were made of
gold, silver, or ivory, and often set with precious stones.
The beautiful wife of Rubens is represented in portraiture
as carrying in her hand a single feather.</p>

<p>The French have long been famous for their fans, and the
manufacture was introduced so early, that a company of fan-workers
was established at Paris in the sixteenth century.
In 1683, Louis XIV. formed them into a special guild. In
his and the two following reigns, fans were of such universal
use that no toilet was considered complete without one.
They were made of perfumed leather or paper, and decorated
by Watteau, Boucher, and other artists, the handle being
often elaborately carved and adorned with jewels. At the
present day, the making of fans is an important branch of
industry at Paris to the extent of £100,000 yearly; one
manufacturer employing, it is said, upwards of two thousand
hands, some of his fans being most tastefully decorated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
the best artists in Paris, the price of a single fan reaching
as high a sum as £1000.</p>

<p>The fan was probably introduced into England early in
the sixteenth century. Stow indeed says that “masks,
muffs, fans, and false hair for women were devised in Italy,
and brought to England from France in 1572, that being
the year of the Huguenot massacre, and of the supremacy
in France of Catherine de Medici and her Italian followers.”
Fans were, however, in use at least as early as the reign of
Henry VIII., when they were carried by young gentlemen,
sometimes on horseback. When ladies walked out, their
fans were carried by servants. They consisted of a tuft of
feathers set on the end of a handle or stick, and had much
the appearance of powder puffs. The most costly were of
ostrich feathers, and looking-glasses were often placed in
the broad part above the handle, which was elaborately
decorated.</p>

<p>The fan was received into great favour by Queen Elizabeth,
who, notwithstanding her great ability in managing the
affairs of the State, and her haughty and imperious temper,
was singularly susceptible to flattery, and bestowed great
care on her personal adornment. Many instances are on
record of her courtiers trying to ingratiate themselves with
her by the present of a fan. Amongst them the great sailor,
Sir Francis Drake, gave her a fan of white and red feathers,
with a gold handle embellished with pearls and diamonds.
Her favourite, the Earl of Leicester, also presented her with a
fan. It was made of white feathers with a gold handle set with
pearls, emeralds, rubies, and diamonds, and a device of “a
lion ramping, with a white bear muzzled at his foot,” in token
of his own complete subjection to his royal mistress, his
cognizance being a bear. At Elizabeth’s death, her wardrobe
was found to contain an immense quantity of clothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
and finery of all descriptions, including as many as twenty-seven
fans.</p>

<p>In her reign a fan was deemed an essential part of a
lady’s dress, and the handle was often made of gold, silver,
or ivory, of curious and expensive workmanship. In a
comedy written about this time occurs the passage, “She
hath a fan, with a short silver handle about the length of a
barber’s syringe;” and a little later, in 1649, Sir William
Davenant says, in <i>Love and Honour</i>, “All your plate, Vaso,
is the silver handle of your own prisoner’s fan.” Shakspeare,
too, repeatedly mentions the fan, as, for instance, in the
following passage in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, the scene of which
is in Italy:—</p>

<p>“<i>Nurse.</i>—My fan, Peter.”</p>

<p>“<i>Mercutio.</i>—Prythee, do good Peter, to hide her face, for
the fan’s the fairer of the two.”</p>

<p>And again, in the same play, showing the custom of carrying
the fan before ladies:—</p>

<p>“<i>Nurse.</i>—Peter, take my fan, and go before.”</p>

<p>Most writers on costume consider that folding-fans, similar
to those used in modern times, were introduced into England,
probably from France, in the reign of James I. Fan-painting
soon became a distinct profession, but we hear
little of the folding-fan during the time of the Stuarts. The
small feather-fan still kept its place as full-dress, as is shown
by a print of the wife of Sir Henry Garway, who was Lord
Mayor of London in 1640, She is represented as holding
in her hand a fan similar to those used in the reign of
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>By the early part of the eighteenth century the fan seems
to have become an object of general use, and to have given
considerable employment to painters, engravers, and makers.
The manufacture, indeed, became so important that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
1709 the company of fan-makers, which is still in existence,
was incorporated by letters patent from Queen Anne. The
fraternity was governed by a master, two wardens, and
twenty assistants; but they have never had either a hall or
livery. The age of Queen Anne produced many distinguished
writers, both in prose and verse; and, as we might
expect, the fan did not escape their observation. It is
mentioned both by Addison and Pope, but more particularly
by Gay, who published, in 1714, a poem entitled “The Fan,”
where he says:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The fan shall flutter in all female hands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And various fashions learn from various lands.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For this shall elephants their ivory shed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And polished sticks the waving engine spread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His clouded mail the tortoise shall resign,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And round the rivet pearly circles shine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On this shall Indians all their art employ,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with bright colours stain the gaudy toy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their paint shall here in wildest fancies flow—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their dress, their customs, their religion show.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So shall the British fair their minds improve,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on the fan to distant climates rove.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Doubtless, the most reasonable deduction to be arrived at
is, that the fan has its origin in necessity; and in itself,
trivial as it may appear, is perhaps of an importance few
would conceive. It is not only an ornament to an <i>élégante</i>
for the purpose, it is said, of flirting and coquetry, but
serves as an instrument to chastise a lap-dog or a puppy.</p>

<p>From the <i>Spectator</i> of June 27, 1711, it appears that it
was no easy matter for a lady to learn the necessary tactics
and manœuvres of the fan, which, correctly acquired, no
doubt formed one of the “accomplishments” of that age.
They are thus described:—“Handle your fan; unfurl your
fan; discharge your fan; ground your fan; recover your fan;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
flutter your fan. By the right observation of these few
plain words of command, a woman of a tolerable genius,
that will apply herself diligently to her exercise for the space
of but one half-year, shall be able to give her fan all the
graces that can possibly enter into that modish machine.”
Directions are also given for the several evolutions, but the
last, “Flutter your fan,” was undoubtedly by far the most
important.</p>

<p>Among the many subjects devised for fans about this
period is a painted one of Bartholomew Fair, temp. 1721,
representing a view of Lee and Harper’s great booth,
Faux, the conjuror, etc. They included also subjects from
the Beggars’ Opera, and the famous works of Hogarth were
called into request for the same purpose. Fans at this time
were of such proportions as to give many opportunities to
caricaturists and writers to make them the object of their
ridicule and wit:—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Say, Jenny, why that monstrous fan?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What purpose does thy bosom move?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is it to save us or trepan?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is it to cure or quicken love?</div>
  </div><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If worn in pity’s gentle cause,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath, unseen, you mean to lie;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I know a thousand eyes it draws,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which else, perhaps, had wandered by.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Abington, a celebrated actress, was considered an
adept at flirting a fan; and being possessed of the highest
refinement of taste in dress, her judgment and opinion were
often solicited by ladies of rank.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pray, ladies, copy Abington;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Observe the breeding in her air;—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s nothing of the actress there.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Assume the fashion, if you can,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And catch the graces of her fan.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>In the <i>Westminster Journal</i> of February 23rd, 1751, a
writer proposed a tax on fan mounts, which, he considered,
would produce a revenue of £30,000 per annum.</p>

<p>In the following year an advertisement appeared in the
<i>Daily Advertiser</i> from <i>employés</i> in the fan trade, thanking
the Company of Fanmakers for their efforts to abolish the
importation of fans, and their endeavours, by asserting the
superiority of home-made fans over those of foreign manufacture,
to gain the patronage of the ladies, and the consequent
relief of the distressed members of the trade, who,
through the extensive imports of foreign-made fans, were
prevented from obtaining employment.</p>

<p>In the year 1753 the journeyman fanmakers presented
the Dowager Princess of Wales with an elegant fan, which
they represented to be far superior to Indian fans. In the
same year a correspondent of Sylvanus Urban published
complaints of snuff-taking by both sexes at church; the
ladies also giving grave offence by the use of the fan mounts
which he saw displayed by a row of ladies while kneeling
at the Communion Table. Among the subjects were:—“Meeting
of Isaac and Rebekah,” “Joseph and Potiphar’s
Wife,” “Darby and Joan,” “Vauxhall Gardens,” “The
Judgment of Paris,” “Harlequin, Pierrot, and Columbine,”
“The Prodigal Son,” scenes from the “Rake’s Progress,” etc.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the last and the beginning of the
present century, fans seem to have ceased to be a necessary
accompaniment to a lady’s toilet, although they are still to be
seen at balls and theatres, and of some utility, perhaps, judging
from a print in which a lady and gentleman are represented
sitting by each other, the gentleman “fluttering the fan,”—</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c218"><i>THE TRIALS OF A PORTRAIT PAINTER.</i></p>

<p>Who can conceive the troubles attendant upon the daily
labour of a face painter? Hoppner once remarked to a
young painter, “I’ll tell you what, sir: when you have
to paint a portrait, particularly of a woman, make it handsome
enough,—your sitter or her friends will find the
likeness. Never you forget that.”</p>

<p>An Italian painter, on taking the portrait of a lady, perceived
that when he was working at her mouth she was
twisting her features in order to render it smaller, and put
her lips into the most extreme contraction. “Do not
trouble yourself so much, madam,” exclaimed the limner;
“for, if you choose, I will draw you without any mouth at
all.” It is needless to repeat here all the tales that have
been told of the difficulties of a face painter. The following
anecdotes will show to what extent of vanity and folly those
people are subject who, though wishing to hand down to
posterity their own portrait or that of some member of their
family, are entirely ignorant of the simplest rules of Art;
and, consequently, give considerable trouble and anxiety to
the artist. For instance, how often in our exhibitions do we
find a portrait painted of a citizen in the dress of a military
man, or a naval officer in the costume of a Roman general
in a toga, with bare arms! Most must be drawn in the
manner of ancient Greece or Rome, instead of their proper
habits; the sitter having his head so full of antiquity that
everything must be according to the ancient taste.</p>

<p>“The grandest commission,” remarks an artist, “that
ever blessed my hopes was a series of family portraits,—father,
mother, a daughter just simpering into womanhood,
and three as noisy, ugly, wiry-looking lads as any one
would wish to hear, and be anxious not to see. All were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
progressing with great satisfaction to the affectionate family
until, in an unlucky moment, I strengthened the shadow
under the nose of Mr. Jones. In a moment all was uproar,
one and all declaring that ‘Father never takes snuff, because
mother thinks it a nasty, filthy habit.’ Out, therefore, came
the shadow, and of course in, therefore, went the nose.
The only objection made to Mrs. Jones’s ‘likeness’ was,
that it did ‘not look at you;’ but how the deuce it ever
should I could never find out, for the original was wholly
incapable of bringing both eyes to bear upon any given
object at one and the same time. The portraits of the
juvenile male Joneses were, as their mother fondly expressed
herself, ‘the very mottle of them;’ ‘but, sir,’ said
she, ‘there is one thing I wish you to alter, I don’t like
the eyes at all. I have been married to Jones these twenty
years, and, as you see, have been a fruitful wife to him; I
have, besides these, two babbies at home, and I do assure
you, sir, and Jones knows it, I never had a child born in
all our marriage days that had a speck in its eye. Please,
sir, to oblige me by putting them out.’ With a groan I
submitted, and painting out the lights I had, as I thought,
properly introduced into the eyes, sent home the portraits
of the young Joneses, every one as blind as a bat. I should
not forget, that when I requested to know whether Miss
Adeliza would be painted in a high or a low dress, her
mother confidentially whispered to me that it was to be
a low one, but I must mind and let the portrait be ‘partic’lar
modest about the neck,’ as it was for a gentleman.”</p>

<p>Another story which he relates is of a rough, honest-hearted
naval captain. “All that I did vastly pleased him,
until, when nearly finishing the picture, I had begun to
throw an incidental shadow across the lower part of the
figure. The gallant gentleman saw in a glass that stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
opposite what I was about to do, and rushing from his
seat, seized my hand, crying out, ‘Avast there, young
gentleman, what are you about? Who the devil ever saw
an officer on the quarter-deck with his breeches in that
mess? No, no, that won’t do.’ I submitted to my fate,
and sent home the portrait with a pair of unpronounceables
of unexceptionable whiteness.”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c219"><i>SEDDON’S PICTURE OF “JERUSALEM.”</i></p>

<p>On the 23rd November, 1856, the gifted young artist,
Thomas Seddon, died at Cairo on his way to the Holy
Land. He was buried with all due solemnity in the same
small cemetery whither he had, two years before, followed
the remains of Mr. Nicholson (a traveller whom he accidentally
met on his first journey to the East), and which he
has touchingly described in a letter written at that time. A
marble slab, surmounted by a simple, plain cross, with the
following inscription at its foot,</p>



<p class="c less">“To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain,”</p>


<p>marks the spot where his remains rest. On the slab itself
is engraved,</p>

<p class="c">
“<span class="large">THOMAS SEDDON</span>, Artist,</p>

<p class="c">
Who died at Cairo, the 23rd of November, 1856.”
</p>

<p>To which is added a verse from one of his favourite hymns,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thou art gone to the grave, but we will not deplore thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Whose God was thy Ransom, thy Guardian, thy Guide;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He gave thee, He took thee, and He will restore thee,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And death had no sting, for the Saviour hath died.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>A short time after the melancholy news of his death had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
arrived in England, some of his artist friends met together
at the house of Ford Maddox Brown, Esq., for the purpose
of considering what steps they could take to testify their
respect for his memory, and their admiration of his works,
which they felt deserved some public notice. They afterwards
invited the co-operation of other gentlemen who had
been acquainted with him and appreciated his efforts, and
convened a meeting at the house of W. Holman Hunt,
Esq., which was numerously attended. Professor Donaldson,
John Ruskin, Esq., and others addressed those present,
Mr. Ruskin, remarking, “that the position which Mr. Seddon
occupied as an artist appears to deserve some public recognition
quite other than could be generally granted to genius,
however great, which had been occupied only in previously
beaten paths. Mr. Seddon’s works are the first which
represent a truly historic landscape art; that is to say, they
are the first landscapes uniting perfect artistical skill with
topographical accuracy; being directed, with stern self-restraint,
to no other purpose than that of giving to persons
who cannot travel, trustworthy knowledge of the scenes
which ought to be most interesting to them. Whatever
degrees of truth may have been attained or attempted by
previous artists have been more or less subordinate to
pictorial or dramatic effect.” At this meeting a committee
was formed, and Mr. W. M. Rossetti appointed honorary
secretary, “for the purpose of raising a subscription for the
purchase of the oil picture of ‘Jerusalem,’ painted by the
late Mr. Thomas Seddon, from his widow, for the sum of
four hundred guineas, and to offer it to the National
Gallery.”</p>

<p>The efforts of the committee were most successful. The
Society of Arts kindly lent their spacious rooms for the
exhibition of his works, which were collected for the purpose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
and visited by a large number of persons. Mr. Ruskin
again came forward, and delivered a most able address on
the subject at a conversazione held for the purpose; and
the result of these generous efforts was that a sum of nearly
£600 was raised by public subscription. With this the
committee purchased his picture of “Jerusalem,” as they
had proposed, and offered it to the Trustees of the National
Gallery, by whom it was accepted; and it is now at the
South Kensington Museum. The balance of the subscription,
after paying the contingent expenses, was presented to
Mrs. Thomas Seddon, as a testimony of the recognition by
the public of the merits of her husband.—<i>Memoir and
Letters of Thomas Seddon, by his Brother.</i></p>

<p>We cannot conclude this interesting account of the late
Thomas Seddon, without introducing the following eloquent
appeal made at the meeting of the Society of Arts already
referred to, by that powerful writer on Art, John Ruskin:—
“Whether they would further the noble cause of truth in
Art, while they gave honour to a good and a great man,
and consolation to those who loved him; or whether they
would add one more to the victories of oblivion, and suffer
this picture, wrought in the stormy desert of Aceldama,
which was the last of his labours, to be also the type of
their reward: whether they would suffer the thorn and the
thistle to choke the seed that he had sown, and the sand of
the desert to sweep over his forgotten grave.”</p>

<p class="c sp" id="c220"><i>A GREAT PICTURE AND ITS VICISSITUDES.</i></p>

<p>One of the noblest paintings of the modern school is
Lawrence’s “Hamlet Apostrophizing the Skull,” in the
churchyard scene, as represented by the famous tragedian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
John Kemble. It is a full-length, life-size, and was painted
in 1801. Cunningham justly describes it as a work of the
highest order,—sad, thoughtful, melancholy; with looks
conversing with death and the grave; a perfect image of the
great dramatist. About the year 1812, this celebrated
picture was exhibited, and for sale, at the European Museum,
King Street, St. James’s, London. Mr. Robert Ashby, the
engraver, of Lombard Street, on visiting the gallery was
surprised to see so fine a specimen of modern art so
situated, and inquired of the keeper as to the circumstance
which led to its degradation, from whom he learnt that Mr.
Maddocks, M.P., had previously purchased it with the
intention of placing it as an altar-piece in a church which
he had recently erected in a village called Tre Madoc, in
Wales; but the bishop of the diocese having expressed his
disapproval of its being placed in the church, the purpose of
Mr. Maddocks was defeated, and he sent the picture for sale
as above. The price demanded was two hundred guineas,
which Mr. Ashby agreed to give: at the same time observing
that if any other purchaser offered during the time of the
gallery remaining open, he would relinquish his right; his
motive being solely to prevent the picture being returned
unsold. The result was that Mr. Ashby became the purchaser
at the price stated, and retained it in his possession
for a time; when the artist, Mr. Lawrence (afterwards Sir
Thomas) wrote to him (Mr. A.), inquiring whether he
would part with the picture, he (Mr. L.) being desirous of
obtaining it for the then Marquis of Abercorn, who had
designed to place it in the saloon at his seat at Stanmore.
Mr. Ashby immediately consented to the re-sale, at the same
sum which he had paid, much gratified at the prospect of
its being so suitably placed. Here another interruption
occurred; the Marquis of Abercorn died, and with him the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
project of removing the “Hamlet” to Stanmore. From
this time it remained in the possession of Mr. Lawrence,
until he obtained the patronage of George IV., who displayed
his liberality and fine taste by purchasing it for one
thousand guineas. William IV., in 1836, presented the
painting to the National Gallery, whence it has since been
transferred to a distinguished place in the South Kensington
Museum.</p>

</div>


<p class="c sp" id="c221"><i>THE FRESCOES IN THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Herbert is, we think, the first painter who has
divested the sacred legislator of adventitious solemnity and
conventional marks of power, and substituted for them the
worn countenance and wasted frame of a chief who leads an
army through the desert, and confers upon them laws destined
to maintain a moral dominion over all the generations
of mankind.</p>

<p>“One reason why Mr. Herbert’s picture is so worthy of its
fame, is, that the painter never grudged labour or loss upon
it. In 1850 he was commissioned to paint nine frescoes in
the Peers’ Robing Room at the price of £9000. For
several years before he had been earning nearly £2000
a year, yet he was willing to give up nine years to work for
about half the sum. When he found that the fresco process
was imperfect, he unhesitatingly obliterated his work, and
began it anew in the water-glass method. He was to have
received £2000 for the ‘Moses,’ but the commission appointed
in 1864 recommended that the price should be
raised to £5000. The same sum is to be paid to Mr.
Maclise for the ‘Death of Nelson,’ and, of course, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
‘Meeting at La Belle Alliance.’ It is plain that when the
thought of decorating the Houses of Parliament with frescoes
was first entertained, no great expense was anticipated.
Mr. Dyce said he understood that in Munich Professor
Schnorr was paid at the rate of £500 a year, which would
be equal to £700 in this country, and had to pay his
assistants. For this sum Mr. Dyce thought the services of
the chief English artists might be commanded, ‘those at
least who are engaged in subjects of fancy. The services of
those who paint portraits would not be obtained at that
sum; but I believe it is taking a high average to state the
income of the more respectable artists of this country at
£500 a year.’ Accordingly, the first frescoes in the House
of Lords were ordered at the rate of £400 for the cartoon,
and £400 for the fresco. Mr. Dyce was to paint the
‘Legend of King Arthur’ in the Queen’s Robing Room,
and to receive £800 a year for six years. The eight compartments
in the Peers’ and Commons’ corridors were to
have been painted in oil, and £500 was to have been paid
for the first picture, and £450 for each of the remainder.
But when frescoes were substituted, the remuneration for
each was raised to £600.</p>

<p>“The prices paid are not extravagant, though of course
somewhat higher than those paid in Germany. It is well
known that King Louis always bought in the cheapest
market. Count Raczynski states that Hess received £3700
for his frescoes in the chapel of All Saints, and £5000 for
those in the basilica of St. Boniface. For the Nibelungen
halls in the Palace, Schnorr, according to the same authority,
was paid £2600; for his frescoes from Walther von de
Vogelweide in the Queen’s first Ante-chamber, Gassen
received £360; Folz for the Burger Room, £460; Kaulbach
for the Throne Room, £300, and for the Sleeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Chamber, £666; Hess for the Theocritus Room, £600; and
Moriz von Schwind for the Tieck Room, £240. Contrast
with these figures the price paid to Kaulbach for his paintings
in the New Museum at Berlin—£37,500, with an
allowance of £3,750 for materials.”—<i>Edinburgh Review,
January, 1866.</i></p>

<p class="c sp" id="c222"><i>THE RIDING MASTER AND THE ELGIN MARBLES.</i></p>

<p>Shortly after the Elgin Marbles were thrown open to the
public indiscriminately, a gentlemanly-looking person was
observed to stand in the middle of the gallery on one spot
for upwards of an hour, changing his attitude only by turning
himself round. At last he left the room, but in the course
of two hours he again took his former station, attended by
about a dozen young gentlemen; and there to them he
made nearly the following observations:—“See, gentlemen,
look at the riders all round the room,” alluding to the
Friezes; “see how they sit; see with what ease and elegance
they ride! I never saw such men in my life; they have no
saddles, no stirrups; they must have leaped upon their
horses in grand style. You will do well to study the position
of these noble fellows; stay here this morning instead
of riding with me, and I am sure you will seat yourselves
better to-morrow.” I need hardly tell the reader that this
person was a riding-master, and that after he had been so
astonished at the sculptor’s riders, he brought all his pupils
to whom he was that morning to have given lessons at his
riding-school.—<i>Smith’s “Nollekens and his Times.”</i></p>

<p class="c sp" id="c223"><i>A HALLOWED SPOT.</i></p>

<p>I had intended to prolong my route to the western corner
of the Green (Kew), but in passing St. Anne’s Chapel, I
found the pew-openers engaged in wiping the pews and
washing the aisles. I knew that child of genius, Gainsborough,
the painter, lay interred here, and, desirous of
paying my homage to his grave, I inquired for the spot.
As is usual in regard to this class of people, they could give
me no information; yet one of them fancied she had heard
such a name before. I was therefore obliged to wait while
the sexton or clerk was fetched, and in the interim I walked
into the chapel. I was in truth well repaid for the time it
cost me; for I never saw anything prettier, except Lord le
Despencer’s exquisite structure at West Wycombe. As the
royal family usually attend here when they reside at Kew, it
is superbly fitted up, and the architecture is in the best taste.
Several marble monuments of singular beauty adorn the
walls, but the record of a man of genius absorbed every
attraction of ordinary rank and title. It was a marble slab
to the memory of Meyer, the painter, with lines by the poet
Hayley.</p>

<p>From hence I strolled into the vestry, when the clerk or
sexton’s assistant made his appearance; and on the south
side of the churchyard he brought me to the tomb of Gainsborough.
“Ah, friend!” said I, “this is a hallowed spot,—here
lies one of Britain’s favoured sons, whose genius has assisted
in exalting her among the nations of the earth.” “Perhaps
it was so,” said the man; “but we know nothing about
the people buried, except to keep up their monuments, if
the family pay; and, perhaps, sir, you belong to this family;
if so, I’ll tell you how much is due.” “Yes, truly, friend,”
said I, “I am one of the great family bound to preserve the
monument of Gainsborough; but if you take me for one of
his relatives, you are mistaken,” “Perhaps, sir, you may
be of the family, but were not included in the will, therefore
are not obligated.” I could not now avoid looking with
scorn at the fellow; but, as the spot claimed better feelings,
I gave him a trifle for his trouble, and mildly told him I
would not detain him. The monument being a plain one,
and making no palpable appeal to vulgar admiration, was
disregarded by these people. It did not fall in the way, of
the untaught, on this otherwise polite spot, to know that
they have among them the remains of the first painter of
our national school in fancy-pictures, and one of the first
in the classes of landscape and portraits; a man who recommended
himself as much by his superiority, as by his
genius; as much by the mode in which his genius was
developed, as by the perfection of his works; and as much
by his amiable private character, as by his eminence in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>

<p>A little to the eastward lie the remains of another illustrious
son of Art, the modest Zoffany, whose Florence
Gallery, portraits of the Royal Family, and other pictures,
will always raise him among the highest class of painters.
He long resided on this Green, and like Michael Angelo,
